                <p>Employees/subcontractors are paid each Thursday for hours worked during the previous week, unless or otherwise on the next business day if there is a public holiday. Payment is made by automatic direct deposit to the employee’s bank account.</p>
                <p>You are responsible for recording your time fully and accurately for all hours worked via the company’s app [Lookout/Careview]. You must include all hours worked, and provide the exact hours and minutes worked. You may not work unrecorded, unreported, or “off-the-clock time” under any circumstances. No one is authorised to tell you otherwise.</p>
                <p>In order to ensure that your paycheck is accurate, you must record your time correctly and without errors. You must acknowledge the accuracy of your invoice (ABN) & timesheet(ABN/TFN) before submitting it to accounts or in the app.</p>
                <p>If corrections or modifications are made to your invoice or timesheet, you must acknowledge the change in writing and send it to accounts@decentcare.com.au.</p>
                <p>It is not acceptable to improperly alter, falsify, or tamper with time records or to record time. Doing so may result in disciplinary action up to and including immediate termination.</p>

                <h2><b> 4.1 </b> Inaccurate Invoices</h2>
                <p>An invoice is an official document when a transaction takes place. Sub-Contractors that are operating under ABN are required to provide invoices for the hours worked each week. </p>
                <p>Errors in the invoice from the sub-contractor incur additional administrative costs for the company leading to further delays in processing the invoices. As a result, it is vital that the employee proof checks the invoices before submitting them.</p>
                <p>Sub-Contractors are responsible for ensuring the following information is accurate before providing an invoice: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Duplication of the invoice number. </li>
                        <li>Providing the wrong number of hours or hourly rates. </li>
                        <li>Providing incorrect personal information [ABN number, Bank account]</li>
                        <li>Providing incorrect working days.</li>
                        <li>Providing the incorrect name of the participant. </li>

                <h2><b> 4.2 </b> Non-Compliance</h2>
                <p>If a sub-contractor is unable to provide their invoice or timesheet by the end of the pay cycle (Sunday 11.59am), the employee will be able to provide the timesheet or invoice with the next billing cycle. However, failing to provide the invoice or timesheet consecutively will result in an admin cost which will be deducted from their pay.</p>
                <p>If there are errors in your invoice Decent care will contact the employee and ask for the invoices to be rectified which will result in a delay in payment.  If the errors are persistent it could result in additional administration costs which will be deducted from their payment</p>

                <p>Employees and sub-contracts can not provide false signatures of the participant and claim for hours that they did not work. At Decent Care, we take this very seriously. Due to the severe nature of the actions, there will be a direct termination of services and further legislative actions might be undertaken and the outstanding amount claimed will not be paid until the investigation's have been completed.</p>
