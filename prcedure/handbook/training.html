                <p><b>9</b> Decent Care is committed to ensuring that all employees are provided with the training they need to perform their jobs safely at all times. As such, Decent Care will maintain and keep under review a list of training that is mandatory for some or all employees/sub-contractor and ensure that the appropriate training is available at the required intervals. <br> <br>All employees/sub-contractor are responsible for their own training and development, including attending relevant induction and mandatory training events. <br> <br>The employees will undergo the appraisal/personal development review process annually with the team leader or the case manager.
                To ensure the employeeâ€™s development in skills, Decent Care will provide employees with quarterly or half-yearly refreshers that are mandatory for the employees to complete. If the employee is unable to reflect the company standards, in that situation Decent Care will organise training for the employee.</p>
