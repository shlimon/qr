                        <li>Fails to report for work as scheduled</li>

                <p>It is your responsibility to communicate with the company regarding your need to be absent. Notification from another employee/sub-contractor or relative is not acceptable, except under emergency conditions.
                    <ul>
                        <li>You must request time off from work in writing and in advance through the DC QR app, following Company policies based on the type of absence (sick leave, vacation, etc.), except in situations involving unforeseeable illness or emergency. The application must be submitted 2 weeks prior to leaving where possible</li>
                        <li>If you are unexpectedly going to be absent due to illness or emergency:
                            <ol>

                                <li>In an emergency situation where advance notice is not possible, you should notify your supervisor as soon as it is possible to do so. Such notifications can only be made through a phone call on 03 9706 7619.</li>
                            </ol>
