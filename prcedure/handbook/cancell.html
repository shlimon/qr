            <h2>8.1 SHORT NOTICE CANCELLATION</h2>
            <p>We understand that there are times when participants may miss an appointment due to
                emergencies or obligations in relation to work or family. In such circumstances, if the participant provides a cancellation notice 24 hours prior to the shift, the employee can claim 2 hours as a cancellation fee.</p>
            <p>A cancellation is deemed a short notice cancellation if the participant:
                <ul>
                    <li>Has given less than 24-hour notice to the support worker. i.e., if the shift was meant to commence at 9 am Tuesday and the participant cancels the shift after 9 am Monday.</li>
                    <li>The employee is still required to record the hours in their timesheet via the lookout app and mention the reason for cancellation in the case notes.</li>

            <h2>8.2 NO SHOW CANCELLATION</h2>
            <p>In certain situations, the employees may arrive at the destination to commence their shift, but the participant is not present. In such circumstances, the employee can claim 2 hours as a cancellation fee.</p>

            <p>A cancellation is a No-Show Cancellation if the participant:
                <ul>
                    <li>Is not present for the appointment and the employee cannot reach the participant via the phone.</li>
                    <li>The employee is required to call the case manager and inform them of the situation. If the case manager asks the employee to cancel the appointment, the employee can claim the cancellation fee as outlined above.</li>
                    <li>The employee is required to log the hours through the app and provide case notes outlining the reason for cancellation.</li>
