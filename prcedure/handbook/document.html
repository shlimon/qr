It is best practice that the employee/sub-contractor completes case notes towards the end of their shifts in situations where this is not possible, employees/sub-contractors are required to complete case notes within 24 hours of the completion of their shift.</p>
                <p>Case notes are to be logged in the company’s app [Lookout/Care view]. If in a situation where the app is not working, notify Decent Care as soon as possible. The employees/sub-contractors are required to log into their timesheet via the DC QR app in such circumstances.  </p>

                <p>Decent Care employees/sub-contractors are provided with a decent care folder that outlines the quality and standards of the case notes. Employees/subcontractors can reflect on the documentation in the DC folder for writing their case notes.</p>

                <p>The case notes should outline the following, 
                    <ul>
                        <li>How the support worker/coordinator has provided service that helps the participant achieve their goals.</li>
                        <li>Writing sentences in “active voice” is recommended as opposed to ‘passive voice”, in order to emphasise the order of the tasks recorded.</li>
                        <li>The case notes should contain factual information. </li>
                        <li>The notes must be specific and informative but also succinct and clear.</li>
                        <li>Progress notes must include both positive as well as negative developments and be written impartially, including any errors made by the carers. </li>
                        <li>Case notes should include the hours worked.</li>
                        <li>The signature of the participant is required after completing the case notes in the DC QR app for the participants to acknowledge the KM's travelled are true and accurate.  [Support Workers].</li>
