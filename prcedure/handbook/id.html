            <p><b>07</b> Decent Care considers the employee/sub-contractor Identification (ID) Card as an important component when working with participants for security and safety purposes. Therefore, the wearing of the ID is non-negotiable. It is the employee’s/sub-contractor's obligation to help keep the work environment safe, and ensure one can always identify the carer. This is done by displaying the ID visibly and clearly on the person at all times while working with a participant. </p>
