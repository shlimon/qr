            <h1>NDIS Code of Conduct</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <p>Decent Care has adopted the underpinning principles of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) Code of Conduct (the Code) as set out in the National Disability Insurance Scheme (Code of Conduct) Rules 2018.</p> 
            <p>The obligations in the Code are fundamental to the rights of people with disability set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
            Decent Care respects and supports the fundamental rights of participants to continue living independently in their own homes and communities with dignity and respect, along with choice and inclusion concerning their support needs and being free to engage an advocate and/or representative of their choice. </p>    
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>The Managing Directors in addition to all team members, contractors and students are required to refer to the policies outlined in the manual throughout their work, as they govern our operations and service delivery. They are expected to uphold the Policy Manual's content and raise any questions or issues.  Related policies and procedures should be read in conjunction with this policy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Code</h2>
            <p>This Code of Conduct sets out, in principle, the behaviours and standards of conduct expected of management, team members and students of the organisation who are providing support and services to a person and to uphold the rights of all participants. </p>

            <p>By offering services to participants, Decent Care always will strive to:  
                <b>Act with respect for individual rights to freedom of expression, self-determination and decision-making in accordance with applicable laws and conventions</b>
                Supporting people with disability to have the right to make their own decisions, to be free to live the life they choose and to have the same rights and freedoms as any other member of the community. All Decent Care team members undertake to understand and educate others that people with disability have full and equal human rights, debunking the historical portrayal of them being dependent, helpless and in need of care and protection.
                </p>

                <p><b >Decent Care will deliver services in a way that maintains the standards and principles that underpin the NDIS </b><br>
                    By delivering supports and services in accordance with the NDIS rules made under the NDIS Act (2013), Decent Care will maintain the standards and principles and uphold the conventions that underpin the NDIS. This includes the principle of the United Nations Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities as well as other international human rights treaties named in the NDIS Act. 
                    Decent Care will also comply with the National Disability Insurance Scheme (Provider Registration and Practice Standards) Rules 2018, which has been developed in line with the National Standards for Disability Services and the National Standards for Mental Health Services.
                </p>

                <p><b>Decent Care will support people with disability to make decisions </b>
                <br>
                Decent Care will support the right to freedom of expression and the right to make decisions about and exercise control over, their own lives. Decent Care ensures people with disability have the right to choice and control about who supports them and how their supports are delivered. They will support people with disability to make decisions by directly engaging with people on any choices or decisions that affect them. People with disability will be consulted about who, if anyone, they want to involve in decisions and discussions about their services and supports, or other aspects of their life.  When a legal guardian or nominee is present, Decent Care will strive to be clear on the decision of which they need to involve them in decision making. However, Decent Care will ensure they listen and support the person to make their own decisions and undertake a Supported Decision-Making model when appropriate.
                </p>
    
                <p><b>Decent Care will communicate in a form, language and manner that enables people with disability to understand the information and make known their will and preferences </b><br>
                    Decent Care supports the right for people with disability to question, seek additional information on, or refuse to receive any part of service.  
                    Decent Care will deliver this by: 
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Communicating in a form, language and manner that is accessible and appropriate for the individual and to use a range of communication tools to communicate with people being supported, using assistive technology and alternative forms of communication such as email, text messages or symbols. </li>

                        <li>Where a person speaks a language other than English or uses Auslan, match the person with a team member who speaks their language or uses Auslan (where possible) or provide supports using qualified interpreters, where these supports are covered by their NDIS plan. </li>


                        <li>Confirm that the person with disability and their families, carer or advocates (where relevant) understand what has been explained and are aware of the potential benefits and risks associated with any part of a proposed plan for the delivery of supports and services. </li>

                        <li>
                            Respond to the will, preferences and concerns of the person with disability in relation to their supports and services ‚Äì addressing requests or complaints where necessary. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Where possible, provide consistent team members, so that they can build a good understanding of individual communication preferences and needs, particularly where an individual has complex communication needs. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>


                <p><b>Respect the privacy of people with disability </b><br>Decent Care will comply with State and Territory privacy laws. 
                    People with disability have a right to privacy in relation to the collection, use and disclosure of information concerning them and the services they receive.  
                    Decent Care will comply with Commonwealth, State, and Territory Laws by respecting and protecting the privacy of everyone that receives support and services from them, or those who provide supports and services.  Decent Care ensures that all team members understand the policies and procedures by providing robust induction processes, including the team member Code of Conduct. Decent Care strives to provide a clear explanation to people with disability about:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The kinds of personal information that will be collected and held, including recorded/audio and visual material </li>
                        <li>Why this information is being held </li>
                        <li>Who will have access to this information </li>

                    <p>Decent Care is aware of certain circumstances where they should disclose information about a person without the consent of the person involved. 
                    This may include child protection matters and reports of incidences where violence, exploitation, neglect, abuse, and sexual misconduct are to be reported to the NDIS Commission and the Police.</p>

                            <p>Any act of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation by a participant prompts an assessment/re-assessment of a participant‚Äôs service package and the delivery of services to ensure their supports are being delivered in a constructive manner that maximises the benefit to the participant. This includes a review of any behaviour support plans by a specialist behaviour support provider to reduce the risks of future violence.</p>

                            <p>Decent Care notes and is aware that if the NDIS notes that a team member considers that a NDIS provider has not responded appropriately to incidents of violence, abuse and neglect or if they think the matter might be of more systemic significance, they are encouraged to report the incident to the NDIS Commission. </p>

                            <p>Decent Care will not use adverse action or threats of adverse action against a team member and understand that the NDIS Commission has legislative powers to protect team members and other people who report incidents to the NDIS Commission and can take regulatory action. </p>

                            <p><b>Take all reasonable steps to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct </b><br>
                                Decent Care supports the right of people with disability to sexual expression and to develop and maintain sexual relationships. Decent Care is committed to providing access to information and supports to assist them to make informed and positive choices about sex, sexuality, relationships and reproductive health and wellbeing, as well as exercise their rights regarding privacy. 
                                Decent Care understands that sexual misconduct is a broad term that encompasses any unwelcome acts or behaviour that are experienced by the person with disability. This includes physical and verbal actions committed without consent or by force, intimidation, coercion or manipulation. It includes sexual violence and exploitation but is not limited to actions which constitute a criminal offence. 
                                Decent Care is committed to their responsibility of the key role in implementing practices that minimise the risk of sexual misconduct with clear guidance for team member behaviour and processes for reporting sexual misconduct to the NDIS Commission and any other relevant authorities. 
                                </p>

                            <p><b>Have in place clear guidance for team member behaviour </b><br>
                                Clear guidance for team member behaviour and response to sexual misconduct is outlined in the team member induction code of conduct training. It explicitly indicates that team members are expected to adhere to the highest standards of behaviour, be respectful and take every action to make sure people with disabilities are safe. <br>
                                This includes having professional boundaries in place for relationships between team members and people with disability and preventing and responding to any inappropriate behaviours by anyone to a person with disability, including sexual misconduct. The code of conduct details that team members will not commit sexual misconduct with persons with disability that they support. <br>
                                Guidance for NDIS team members includes: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Distinguishing between sexual misconduct and appropriate conversations around a participant‚Äôs sexual support or family planning needs</li>
                                <li>Distinguishing between inappropriate touching and appropriate touching  </li>
                                <li>Guide team members in setting boundaries with the person they are working with  </li>
                                <li>Guide team members in determining whether their own or others‚Äô relationships have become inappropriate and instruct them to cease any such relationship</li>
                                <li>It is understood that team members found not to have complied with a professional code or standard regarding sexual misconduct whilst providing NDIS supports and services may be regarded as breaching the NDIS Code of Conduct. </li>

                            <p><b>Operate effective processes for dealing with sexual misconduct </b><br>
                                Decent Care undertakes effective processes for dealing with sexual misconduct by ensuring there are appropriate policies and procedures in place for team members to identify and report any alleged sexual misconduct, unlawful sexual or physical conduct or inappropriate relationships internally and to the NDIS Commission and other relevant authorities. 
                                Decent Care is committed to creating an environment in which people with disability feel safe and are informed about how to make a complaint about any alleged sexual misconduct and without fear of retribution or loss of service. Decent Care also has processes in place to facilitate access to independent advocacy support, or support for harm or trauma experiences if the person desires this support. 
                                Decent Care is aware of its requirement to notify the NDIS Commission under The National Disability Insurance Scheme (Reportable Incidents) Rules 2018 about allegations of sexual misconduct.

            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Decent Care is committed to pursuing the rights and principles of equality, independence, choice and inclusion that underpin a person- centred philosophy.
                In achieving this goal, Decent Care acknowledge that some participants may need assistance to understand issues fully and to voice individual needs and concerns. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the National Disability Strategy promotes social and economic inclusion for people with disability. The availability of high quality, accurate, appropriate and timely information is a key determinant of how well a person can plan and make decisions that affect their lives. Decent Care recognises and supports that participants have the right to choose to involve an advocate to act on their behalf and promote, protect and ensure their full and equal enjoyment of all human rights enabling community participation.
                The purpose of this policy is to provide an overarching framework for recognition and engagement with advocates who are working with participants to ensure that the rights and wishes of the individual are adequately informed and at the centre of the decision-making process.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Scope</h2>

            </div>


            <div class="section">
                <h2>Principles</h2>
                <p>Decent Care recognises that for a person to lead an inclusive life they may require their family, friends, colleagues and other important people in their life to have access to information so they can better support and interact to achieve real social inclusion.  In order to exercise choice and maximise independence, people require access to accurate information that will help them manage their own lives, understand their options, manage issues and grievances, access community, and engage on topics of interest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Policy</h2>
                <p>Decent Care acknowledges that any participant of the service has the right to seek support of an advocate or advocacy agency to help them with all aspects of service delivery provided by Decent Care or from other providers.
                    Whenever possible participants will be supported and encouraged to self-advocate however, Decent Care will facilitate access for a participant to use an advocate should they wish Decent Care to do so.
                    It is acknowledged that at times Decent Care team members will be asked to attend meetings in a professional capacity to present information on behalf of the participant. In these circumstances it is expected that this representation will be restricted to senior team member positions.
                    Decent Care will not disclose any information about the participant to an advocate, when the participant is not present, unless the participant has given express permission to do so. If a participant wishes the organisation to disclose information to an advocate, they will be required to disclose this information in writing.

                    <h2>Procedure</h2>

                    <p>A report of abuse may be received from: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A person using the service by any communication that they prefer to use</li>
                        <li>A team member or any other person, who may witness abuse of a person and make a report; or</li>
                        <li>A team member upon observing one or more indicators of abuse suspects that a person/s have been or is being abused.</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p>The following procedures must be followed where abuse of any sort towards a participant is known or suspected. </p>

                    <p><b>Emergency response</b> <br>Team members who are present at the time of the assault will: <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Take appropriate measures to maintain their own safety, and that of other participants and team members</li>
                        <li>Ensure that the person/s (the victim) is protected from any further harm or contact with the person who is the source of abuse (the offender)</li>
                        <li>Notify the ambulance if the participant or anyone else is injured</li>
                        <li>Immediately advise the Managing Directors of the incident</li>
                        <li>Contact the Police if a person has been physically or sexually assaulted or dies as a result of an assault</li>
                        <li>Contact the local Sexual Assault Service if a person has been sexually assaulted</li>
                        <li>If the matter involves a person under the age of 18 years, concerns are to be reported about the immediate safety of a child to: <b>Deptarment of Health and Human Services: 1300 655795 (Vic)</b></li>
                    </ol></p>

                    <p>Protecting evidence <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Team members at the scene must endeavour to ensure that any evidence the Police may require in their investigation is not disturbed</li>
                        <li>Evidence may be lost if a victim of sexual assault bathes soon after the assault. Try to delay bathing until the Police arrive if the victim is not distressed about the delay</li>
                        <li>If possible, preserve the victim‚Äôs clothing as evidence following an assault of any type</li>
                        <li>If possible, isolate the area where the incident occurred and do not allow anyone to enter the area until the Police arrive</li>
                        <li>Apart from ascertaining their physical condition and state of mind, avoid questioning the person about the incident to reduce contamination of their recall and confusion about the events.</li>
                    </ol></p>


                    <p>The Managing Directors role in an emergency response <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Ensure that all emergency procedures have been followed and the appropriate emergency services have been called</li>
                        <li>Ensure that the victim‚Äôs wishes are followed in relation to advising family, carer or other support person about the incident, where the victim is capable of making this known. When the victim is not capable then the Managing Directors will make sure the appropriate person is notified of the incident as soon as possible</li>
                        <li>Ensure that documentation of the incident is completed.</li>
                        <li>Ensure that external reporting requirements to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission are undertaken</li>
                    </ol></p>


                    <p><b>Actual or alleged abuse by a Decent Care team member</b> <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If witnessed or suspected that a Decent Care team member has abused a person/s, the Managing Directors must be informed immediately</li>

                        <li>Where management reasonably believes that a team member is the source of abuse of a participant, the matter must be referred to the Police. The referral and management of the incident will be managed by the Managing Directors</li>
                        <li>Any allegations of abuse by a team member towards a participant will be the subject of internal investigations within Decent Care and the Police</li>
                        <li>If after an investigation it is found that the team member has abused a person, the matter may warrant dismissal of Decent Care team member as well as any disciplinary action taken by the Police. </li>
                        <li>Team members will not accompany the offender to the police station to provide support. If support is required, this will be provided by an independent person or a legal advisor</li>

When the victim and/or the offender are not capable then the Managing Directors will notify the appropriate person of the incident</li>
                        <li>The Managing Directors will facilitate access to appropriate support, where practical for both the person, their families and team members, and ensure they have information about available services</li>
                        <li>If the Managing Directors reasonably believes that an incident between two persons is abuse or assault, the matter will be referred to the Police</li>
                        <li>If a team member accompanies the offender, who is a participant, to the police station to provide support, the team member must not give an opinion about the offender or the alleged incident, give the offender legal advice, question the offender on behalf of the police or interpret the offender‚Äôs actions. An independent person or a legal adviser will replace the team member as soon as possible.</li>
                    </ol></p>

                    <p><b>Responding to abuse of a participant by another participant</b><br>Decent Care manages the interactions between persons using the service to avoid incidents of abuse, and record behaviour management plans and risk profiles that may cause one participant to harm another. If the advised behaviour management strategies fail to prevent the abuse of one person by another, actions are implemented to protect any person/s from further harm. A review of the circumstances pertaining to the event is conducted within a reasonable timeframe. Any behaviour management strategies implemented by the service are safe, respectful of the person and non-abusive.</p>

                        <li>When the victim is unable to make decisions about any aspect of the incident, a family member/carer must be present to make decisions on the victim‚Äôs behalf.</li>
                    </ol></p>

                    <p><b>Support for the participant</b> <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The victim and family/carer or other support person will be assisted to access any debriefing, counselling, legal or other support services if that is their wish</li>

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care management and team members are committed to effectively identifying, disclosing and managing any actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest in order to protect the integrity of Decent Care and to manage any associated risk. </p>

                    <h2>Scope</h2>
                    <p>This policy applies to team members, students and any person representing of Decent Care.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Principles</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care aims to provide ethical services with integrity that provides participants and their careers with assurance and transparency in relation to any perceived or real conflict of interest.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Policy</h2>
                    <p>This policy has been developed to provide direction to address actual or perceived conflicts of interest affecting Decent Care and their participants. 
                    It is the policy of Decent Care as well as a responsibility of team members, that ethical, legal, financial or other conflicts of interest be avoided and that any such conflicts (where they do arise) do not conflict with professional or organisational obligations. This will be conducted by ensuring that:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Organisational or ethical values do not impede a participant‚Äôs right to choice and control</li>
                        <li>As individual conflicts arise, they are identified, reported, acted upon, and analysed </li>
                        <li>Advice to a participant about support options is transparent and provides all opportunities </li>
                        <li>All participants are treated equally, and that no participant is given preferential treatment above another in the receipt of provision of supports.</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p><b>Decent Care will manage conflicts of interest by requiring team members to: </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remain aware of the potential for conflicts of interest to arise which may affect their ability to exercise professional discretion and unbiased judgment</li>
                        <li>Avoid conflicts of interest where possible</li>
                        <li>Do not provide financial advice to participants at any time</li>
                        <li>Identify and disclose any conflicts of interest</li>
                        <li>Consult with their Program Manager where potential conflicts of interest do arise to find an appropriate resolution</li>
                        <li>Carefully manage any conflicts of interest where they have been reported and analysed</li>
                        <li>Follow this policy and respond to any breaches</li>
                    </ul></p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>

                    <p><b>Identification and disclosure of conflicts of interest</b> <br>Once an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest is identified, a Conflict-of-Interest Form must be completed (through the QR Code) by the person declaring the conflict within 24-hours.  The declared conflict of interest will then be entered onto the Conflict-of-Interest Register. <br> <br>
                    The Conflict-of-Interest Register must be maintained by the Managing Directors. The register must record all information related to a conflict of interest (including the nature and extent of the conflict of interest and any steps taken to address it). </p>


                    <p><b>Action required to manage conflicts of interest</b>In deciding what approach to take, the Program Manager and where required the Managing Director of Operations and discloser will consider: <ul>
                        <li>Whether the conflict needs to be avoided or simply documented </li>
                        <li>Whether the conflict will realistically impair the disclosing person‚Äôs competency and capacity to impartially participate in decision-making </li>
                        <li>Alternative options to avoid the conflict </li>
                        <li>If accepted, what management strategies will be undertaken </li>
                        <li>Decent Care‚Äôs resources </li>
                        <li>The possibility of creating an appearance of improper conduct that might impair confidence in, or the reputation of, the business. </li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>The action and result of the decision will be recorded in the Conflict of Interest Register for future reference.</p>

                    <p><b>Multiple relationships</b><br>A multiple or dual relationship is a situation where multiple roles exist between a team member and a participant. Multiple relationships can occur when: a personal and professional relationship exists between a team member and participant, when a team member has a professional or personal relationship with a person closely related or connected to the participant, or when multiple professional relationships exist between the team members and participant e.g. support worker and support coordinator.  
                    Decent Care team members should avoid engaging in multiple relationships that may impair their competence, effectiveness or objectivity. 
                    Where multiple relationships with participants are unavoidable due to over-riding ethical considerations, organisational requirements, or by law, team members will:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Declare the multiple relationships using the Conflict-of-Interest Form</li>
                        <li>Consult with their Program Manager to attempt to find an appropriate resolution that is in the best interest of all involved parties.</li>
                        <li>Clarify professional boundaries with the participant from the outset of the professional relationship.</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p><b>Multiple support that includes Plan Management and Support Coordination </b><br>Decent Care maintain three distinct programs within their service provision including support coordination, support services and plan management with a Program Manager overseeing each program. Participant information is stored within each programs CRM and can only be accessed by team members working within the program of supports they are receiving. Where a participant is accessing dual support, they will have a separate service agreement for each program and consent will be sought to share any information. <br><br>
                    When delivering Plan Management and Support Coordination, team members must only recommend and provide supports that are appropriate to the needs of participants. This means providing truthful information about the:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Capacity, qualifications, training and professional affiliations of providers and their team members</li>
                        <li>Supports, services or products delivered by providers, including Decent Care; and</li>
                        <li>Full costs of support and what these include.</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p>Information provided to support participants‚Äô decision making may include quotes, cost breakdowns for different support options; other people‚Äôs feedback about supports they‚Äôve received and the risks or different support options; other people‚Äôs feedback about supports they‚Äôve received and the risks and benefits of different supports.</p>

                    <p>Delivery of additional supports <ul>
                        <li>Decent Care must include and monitor the conflict of interest related to delivering Plan Management and/or Support Coordination along with other NDIS supports in the participant‚Äôs progress notes and report to the Managing Director of Operations where an issue emerges</li>
                        <li>The conflict of interest must be declared to all participants using Decent Care Plan Management and/or Support Coordination services, as part of their intake and assessment process through the Appendix A attached to the service agreement. Strategies to address the conflict must also be explained. Should a participant choose to use another provider because of this conflict, team members must respect their decision.</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p>Strategies that Decent Care has in place to manage the conflict of interest involved in delivering Support Coordination along with other NDIS supports include: <ul>
                        <li>Maintaining a clear separation of responsibilities between Support Coordination team members and other team members including separate reporting lines</li>
                        <li>Providing participants with the option of several providers for each type of support they are seeking</li>
                        <li>Where only one option of provider can be suggested for a particular support, thoroughly documenting the rationale for this, and reviewing it regularly</li>
                        <li>Keeping detailed records of any issues that arise with supports provided to a participant by Decent Care, including the actions taken and how the issue was resolved</li>
                        <li>Continually working with participants and other areas of Decent Care to understand how well their supports are meeting their needs and adjusting support delivery before issues emerge</li>
                        <li>Explaining the difference between Support Coordination and other supports funded in participants‚Äô NDIS plans, including the requirement that supports provided be reasonable and necessary; and</li>
                        <li>Explaining that any choice participants make about providers of other supports will not impact the provision of their Support Coordination.</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p>Strategies Decent Care has in place to manage the conflict of interest involved in delivering Plan Management along with other NDIS supports include: <ul>
                        <li>Maintaining a clear separation of responsibilities between Plan Management team members and other team members</li>
                        <li>Continually monitoring its financial practices to ensure participants‚Äô NDIS funds are accounted for separately to Decent Care funds; and</li>
                        <li>Used for the purpose they were provided and in participants‚Äô best interests.</li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>Participants must also be informed about their right to change Support Coordinators and/or Plan Managers and how they can go about doing so, as well as Decent Care feedback and complaints processes (see the Feedback and Complaints Policy). The action and result of the decision will be recorded in the Conflict of Interest Register for future reference.</p>
                    <p><b>Compliance with this policy</b><br>
                    If there is reason to believe that a person has failed to comply with the policy, then an investigation of the circumstances will be conducted.
                    If it is found that that person failed to disclose a conflict of interest, then the Managing Directors may commence disciplinary action.  
                    If a team member suspects a failure to disclose a conflict of interest, they must notify the Managing Directors, who will address it in confidence with the identified person.

                    <h2>Definition of conflicts of interests</h2>
                    <p>A conflict of interest occurs when a person‚Äôs individual interests, conflict with their responsibility to act in the best interests of the business or participant. 
                    Personal interests include direct interests, as well as those of family, friends, or other organisations a person may be involved with or have an interest in. 
                    It also includes a conflict between a team member‚Äôs duty and another duty that the team member has (for example another occupation).  A conflict of interest may be actual, potential or perceived and may be financial or non-financial. 
                    These situations present the risk that a person will make a decision based on, or affected by, these influences, rather than in the best interests of Decent Care or their participants.
                    </p>

                    <p> <strong> <em>Examples of a Conflict of Interest may include (but not limited to):</em> </strong></p>

                    <h3>Gifts and Benefits</h3>
                    <p>Decent Care management and team members must not accept any offer of money, gifts, services or benefits that would cause them to act in a manner contrary to the best interest of a participant. </p>
                    <h3>Influencing Choice and Commissions</h3>
                    <p>Decent Care will not have any financial or any other personal interest that could directly influence or compromise the choice of provider or provision of support to a participant. This includes the obtaining or offering of any form of commission.</p>
                    <h3>Referring participants to associated Providers</h3>
                    <p>Decent Care will always ensure the participant is provided options without influence when offering support options. </p>
                    <h3>Referring participants to internal service offering</h3>
                    <p>Decent Care will ensure that where a participant requires multiple supports, and one of those services is available through Decent Care, three options will be provided. </p>

This includes team members‚Äô emotional well-being that is reflected in the support that they provide to their participants.</p>
                    <p>Decent Care is guided by the Work Health and Safety Policy 2011 and Victorian Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (OHS Act) that provides a broad framework for improving standards of workplace health and safety to reduce work-related injury and illness. The WHS Act aims to: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Secure the health, safety and welfare of team members and other people at work</li>
                            <li>Protect the public from the health and safety risks of business activities</li>

                    <p><b>Where team members safety is at threat</b> <br>If a team member feels at any time unsafe in the provision of service, they should leave the site immediately and inform their Program Manager. <br>If it is not possible, or practicable, the team member should advise the participant that they need to make a phone call to the office.  <br>
                        When the phone is answered the team member should say: <br>
                    <i>‚ÄúI have left my red folder on the desk‚Äù,</i> <br>
                    The answering person should respond:

Where complaints require investigation or more formal review, sufficient resources are allocated to ensure that complaints are effectively and professionally managed, thoroughly investigated by suitably skilled team members who will, if required, seek guidance from the external agencies such as the NDIS Commission.

                    <h2>Procedure</h2>
                    <p>Incident management processes are provided to the participant in the Welcome Pack in an appropriate language, terms or mode of communication. Any stakeholder wanting to report an incident report can do so. 
                    Decent Care will afford all reporters the highest standard of confidentiality.  Incident matters will only be discussed with those on a need-to-know basis and will not be a matter of discussion between any other individuals. All documentation will be retained in a secure place and in compliance with all privacy policies and legislation.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Decent Care incident triage process:</b></p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Once the initial triage has been applied, the Program Manager and Managing Director of Operations (where required) will undertake an investigation to identify the root causes and apply the appropriate remedial action.  Once an incident report is lodged an alert is sent to the Decent Care office and the incident information is entered onto the Incident Register. Correspondence regarding the outcome of the incident resolution is provided to the participant.
                    Investigation of incidents will not be conducted by a person about whom was involved in the incident.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Procedure</h2>
                    <p><b>Governance Risk Management</b> <br>Decent Care Governance Framework includes a Business Continuity Plan and Emergency Plan (BCP) that provides key contacts and directions for team members to follow in the case of an emergency The BCP is tested and reviewed regularly to maintain effectiveness. Reports of testing are reviewed by the Managing Directors and remedial actions are undertaken. Testing processes include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Testing information backup systems</li>
                        <li>Testing team members knowledge</li>
                        <li>Testing participant knowledge of their personal Emergency Plans. </li>

                    </ul></p>
                    <p>Furthermore, risks and associated strategies are documented in the Business Risk Management Register. See also Master Register</p>

                    <p><b>Emergency Officer </b> <br>The Emergency Plan identifies an Emergency Officer. The Emergency Officer (in this case the Managing Directors) will provide leadership and delegation in the following processes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Review the BCP</li>

                    <p><b>Participant Personal Emergency Management Plans</b> <br>Each participant who is deemed to rely on the service for daily needs undertakes Emergency Planning at the commencement of service as part of the Intake Process. 
                    The Emergency Management Plan is located within the participant file that includes the following critical information that is necessary in an emergency:
                    <ul>

                    <p>The plan is explained to the participant and their support network in a language, terms and mode of communication that will best suit their communication needs. 
                    The Emergency Officer will monitor weather conditions and implement the Emergency Management Plan prior to the event, to ensure that participants are supported during an emergency or disaster situation. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Team members must action the Personal Emergency Plan and review all other critical information e.g medical plans prior to undertaking action in an emergency.</p>
                    <p>The Managing Directors must be advised immediately by team members about any difficulties experienced in actioning the plan </p>

                    <h2>Scope</h2>
                    <p>This policy applies to all Management and team members who are involved in the planning of participant supports. </p>
                </div>


                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Principles</h2>
                    <p>Goal Planning is an important component of Decent Care support process to ensure that each participant can achieve success in their chosen activities. The ‚ÄúAbout Me and My Supports‚Äù is a holistic and collaborative process that explores participants aspirations and defines their chosen activities. Goal plans are developed based on the information sourced from the About Me and My Supports Form, whilst identifying individual participant risk. Goal plans are reviewed on a regular basis to monitor outcomes as well as review and manage any risks.</p>

                    <h2>Policy</h2>
                    <p>Individual planning and review processes aim to support people to move toward a more positive lifestyle through enhancing decision-making opportunities and facilitating social integration, participation, and inclusion in the community. The planning process also provides information to maintain safety and continuity of support in the event of natural disaster.</p>
                    <p>The ‚ÄúAbout Me and My Supports‚Äù provides information about all plans associated with the care of the participant as well as a guide to supporting participant needs and personal preferences. This includes where relevant: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>My Safety Plan (formerly the risk and vulnerability assessment)</li>
                            <li>My Goal Plan that includes personal goals and health-related goals (including goal activity risk assessment)</li>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>
                    <p><b>Goal Planning, risk management and review process</b><br>The intake procedure provides the basis for all planning (see Intake and Transition Policy and Procedure) and serves as the ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù component of the ‚ÄúAbout me and My Supports‚Äù. The About me and My Supports Form provides information about the participant and indicates further planning requirements. The following steps should be taken when conducting support planning with participants:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Review the incoming transition form to identify previous supports and transition plan. </li>
                        <li>Review the About Me and My Supports Form and ensure all plans that are identified as required are included in the participant‚Äôs file</li>
                        <li>Considering the plans that do apply, commence the goal planning process including any health goals that have been identified. This is undertaken in collaboration with the participant, inviting them to include an advocate in the process. </li>
                        <li>Support the participant with access to current and accessible information about appropriate and accessible resources and services to help them make informed decisions and choices</li>
                        <li>Identify risks associated with goals and developing management strategies to remove or minimise the impact of the risk. Risks are reviewed regularly to ensure effectiveness</li>
                        <li>Explaining the risks and consequences in the choices being considered</li>
                        <li>Incorporate flexibility into the planning, development and review steps to capture the ongoing changing needs of participants and their families/carers, including their health needs, sexuality and self-protection requirements</li>
                        <li>On completion, ask participant if they would like a copy of the About Me and My Supports Form, Goal Plan and Emergency Plan. Once this has been provided to them, ask them (or their support person) to sign to acknowledge offer of the copy or receipt. </li>
                        <li>Enquire with participant if they would like the goal planning documents shared with family, support network or other providers.  If yes, the consent form must be signed </li>
                        <li>Where appropriate and with the participant's consent, developing and maintaining linkages through collaboration with other providers by sharing information to help meet the participant's needs</li>
                        <li>Adjust the support delivery in a reasonable way and continuously monitoring to ensure it is fit for purpose and the participant's health, privacy, quality of life and independence is supported</li>
                        <li>The goal plan document is shared with all Decent Care team members who are involved in the participants supports.  This includes ensuring each team member is trained to respond to emergencies, including how to distinguish between urgent, and non-urgent health situations</li>
                        <li>All goal plans and risk assessments are reviewed annually, or sooner if the participant circumstances change, or they request an update. </li>
                    </ol></p>

                    </ul></p>

                    <p><b>Planning Principles</b></p>

                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Person at the centre</p>
                        <p>Participants are central to planning and decision-making to achieve their preferred lifestyle. The participant chooses the level of participation in planning according to her or his preference and ability and is encouraged and supported to have as much control as possible over the whole planning process.</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Considering culture</p>
                        <p>Planning takes into consideration the culture, language, religious beliefs and priorities of all people. Planning with a participant is undertaken about social customs and traditions and the individuals own culture and beliefs.</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Inclusion of others</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the person's wishes and consent, their personal support networks and other supporting service providers are actively included in the planning and review process.
                        The inclusion of others in the support planning process aims to encourage the ongoing involvement in the person's life, and to encourage and assist growth of the participant's networks and community engagement.
                        </p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Personal priorities and strengths</p>
                        <p>Intake processes include the identification of the persons strengths, including their personal networks and interests. This information is utilised to develop a capacity building approach and instil confidence in the self-delivery of the plan.</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Dignity of risk</p>
                        <p>Each participant's right to the dignity of risk in decision making is supported. When needed, each participant is supported to make informed choices about the benefits and risks of the options being considered</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Continuous process</p>
                        <p>Planning with the person at the centre is a continuous process of listening, learning and further action and is not a one-off event. Person-centred planning assumes that people with disability have futures, and that their aspirations will change and grow with their experiences.</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Consultation</p>
                        <p>Decent Care operates within a learning culture and supports that each person is the expert in their own lives. Whilst the policy draws on the expertise within Decent Care, the policy will evolve with consultation with team members, participants and their families, carers and advocates.</p>

                        <p><b>Training</b></p>
                        <p>All team members are trained in intake, assessment, goal planning, review and risk management processes as part of the induction.</p>

                    <p>Decent Care acknowledges all people have the right to accurate, clear and transparent information when enquiring, or accessing or transitioning from the service. This information is provided to inform their decision making.
                    The intake process is undertaken to identify the individuals needs and preferences. This information is utilised to identify the plans required and to identify and manage risks associated with their supports and daily living. 
                    Transition planning supports participants who are accessing or leaving the service to do so, in a planned, communicated and risk managed way to minimise any negative impacts that may arise during the process. 
                    Decent Care acknowledges that each person has the right to refuse a service or leave Decent Care at any time they choose. Furthermore, it is acknowledged that Decent Care may discontinue a service in consultation with the person, their family and other important members of the person‚Äôs support network if the service is no longer sustainable or appropriate to the participant.
                    Decent Care is committed to working with and referring to other community services or organisations to meet the multiple needs of participants.
                    Exit procedures will be fair, transparent, follow due process and uphold the rights of participants.

                    </p>

                    <p><b>Initial Meeting</b> <br>On entry to the service, an initial meeting will be arranged with the participant, their family/carers and other significant people from their support network This may take place at the person‚Äôs home, or other suitable community venue. The initial meeting provides an opportunity to further discuss the participant needs and to review any documentation available, including a transition form from a previous provider, if available. 
                    Where a person provides their NDIS Plan, Decent Care will determine if the organisation is able to deliver the specific supports detailed. If the NDIS Plan has not been provided, Decent Care will request the participant‚Äôs NDIS Participant Number (for Agency Managed participants). Decent Care acknowledges that participants do not have to provide their NDIS Plan if they do not wish to. 
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Welcome pack </b>The participant will receive a Welcome Pack explaining their rights while receiving supports from Decent Care. This information is discussed in a format that best meets the participants communication needs.</p>

                    <p><b>The service agreement</b><br>Service agreements are developed in collaboration with the participant where all components of the agreement are discussed. This includes what services will be provided and how often.  All costs associated with the delivery of service are clearly detailed outlining the amount per hour and total budgeted cost for the period
                    The service agreement is signed by both parties, and the participant is provided a copy of the agreement. In the instance where the participant is unable to sign, and a representative is not present, a note will be made outlining the circumstances under why this occurred. A service agreement is created for each program the participant is accessing from Decent Care (e.g. Support Coordination, Support Services, Plan Management), to manage conflict of interest involved in providing multiple support.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>About Me and My Supports (Intake and Assessment)</b> <br>All participants who enter the service will, in collaboration with the relevant Program Manager, complete an About Me and My Supports Form. The information informs and determines the goal planning activities and service provision and ensures that the participant is receiving supports in line with their needs and preferences.</p>

                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Personal preferences</p>
                    <p>The About Me and My Support Form identifies the individuals‚Äô personal needs and preferences to ensure a person-centred approach is provided in the delivery of services. This information includes the participants: <ul>

                    </ul></p>

                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Specialised Plans required</p>
                    <p>The About Me and My Supports Form identifies which plans will be required in order to effectively support the participant. These plans ensure comprehensive supports are provided. </p>
                    <p>Where identified, this will include: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Goal planning, including health needs and risk assessment (mandatory)</li>
                            <li>Communication Plan (dependent of participant requirements</li>
                            <li>Medication Plan (dependent on participant requirements)</li>
                            <li>Mealtime Management Plan (dependent on participant requirements)</li>
                            <li>Specialised module plans e.g behaviour support, SDA etc. See also Individualised Planning Policy and Procedure</li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Vulnerability assessment (My Safety Assessment)</b> <br>An important feature of the intake process is for a vulnerability assessment to be undertaken. The outcome of this assessment is recorded within the Master Register and determines the frequency of management oversight required in the provision of supports to ensure participant safety and quality of care.  This process is informed by the Prevention of Violence, Abuse, Neglect, Exploitation and Discrimination, as well as Emergency Management Planning (See also Prevention of Violence, Abuse, Neglect, Exploitation and Discrimination Policy and Procedure and Emergency Management Policy and Procedure.  The My Safety Assessment, additionally outlines individual risks and mitigation strategies for the participant.</p>

                    <p><b>Environmental safety checklist </b></p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Where supports are provided in the home </p>
                    <p>Where supports are provided in the participants home, an environmental safety checklist will be undertaken in consultation with the participant. The checklist allows Decent Care to identify any risks to the participant or team member in the provision of supports. 
                    Where there are identified risks, risk management strategies will be developed and the appropriate alerting mechanism will be implemented for the team member (See also Work, Health and Safety Policy and Procedure).
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Where supports are provided in settings other than the home </p>
                    <p>Where support is being provided in alternative setting, a risk assessment will be undertaken in consultation with the participant. Where risks are identified, the appropriate management strategies will be developed and recorded within the participants progress notes</p>


                    <p><b>Exiting the Service </b></p>
                    <p>A person may leave Decent Care for a number of reasons or circumstances including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>They no longer wish to access the services provided by Decent Care</li>
                            <li>A person has met all of the planned goals</li>
                            <li>Relocation to an area outside Decent Care‚Äôs area of service delivery</li>
                            <li>Where the service is no longer able to meet the person‚Äôs needs or assist in achieving chosen goals</li>
                            <li>The person is unwilling to meet the reasonable conditions required in their service agreement and thus affecting the safe delivery of a service to the participant and the health and safety of team members</li>
                            <li>Changes in the person‚Äôs condition results in the support they require exceeds the skills and expertise Decent Care can deliver</li>
                            <li>There has been no contact between the person and Decent Care for a period of three (3) months.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Service Transition</b></p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Transition</p>
                    <p>Where a person is transitioning or transferring from another service provider, Decent Care will seek permission from the person and/or their family/carer to contact their ingoing/outgoing provider to obtain information about support requirements to assist support delivery during the transition. 
                    This process includes the development of a documented plan to support the transition across services. 
                    The process includes undertaking a documented risk assessment and management plan to minimise any negative impact arising from the change. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Temporary transitions</p>
                    <p>Where a participant undertakes a temporary transition, including to a health care setting or hospitalisation, Decent Care ensures transition planning occurs to support the participant with the process. This includes undertaking a comprehensive risk assessment that is reviewed and communicated throughout the temporary period, to ensure strategies that are developed minimise any negative impacts arising from the arrangement.</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Where it is not the person‚Äôs choice to exit the service</p>
                    <p>Information regarding the reasons for being asked to leave the service will be provided and explained to the participant. These reasons will be included in the transition plan if required. 
                    The service transition will only be actioned after discussion and consultation with the participant, their family/carer and other important stakeholders, and strategies have been implemented to meet irreconcilable differences.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Exit interview</p>
                    <p>As part of the transition strategy the participant and their family or carer will be offered the opportunity to participate in an exit interview. Communication methods appropriate for the participant and supporters will be used to assist this process as required. This information will inform the continuous improvement and feedback processes to refine services and identify any training requirements for the service.</p>


                    <p><b>Training</b><br>All Decent Care team members receive training in relation to intake and transition procedures at induction and through ongoing practice review.</p>

                        </p>


                        <p><b>Vehicle safety checks</b> <br>Decent Care will ensure the manufacturer's specified service schedule is being adhered to and any identified vehicle faults or wear and tear items are repaired. The vehicle must not be used if there is a mechanical concern, or where the pre-safety check identifies an issue with the vehicle's safety. The Managing Directors will arrange for repair of the vehicle before it is returned to service. <br>When undertaking vehicle pre-use safety checks, team members will, at a minimum:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inspect all external lights (grime can reduce their effectiveness by up to 40%)</li>
                            <li>Inspect wiper blades to ensure they clear the windscreen effectively</li>
                            <li>Clean the windscreen and rear window to ensure good visibility</li>
                            <li>Periodically check all fluid levels - engine oil, windscreen washer fluid and the radiator coolant</li>
                            <li>Check tyre pressure and condition; and</li>
                            <li>Ensure mirrors are present and oriented correctly for use.</li>
                        </ul></p>

                        <p><b>Seat belts</b> <br>By law, all occupants of a vehicle must wear seatbelts at all times. If a seat belt is starting to show signs of wear and tear, (frayed, not retracting back) the vehicle needs to be seen by an authorised repairer. For Decent Care-owned vehicles (where applicable), team members should refer the matter to their Program Manager. If transporting participants who cannot wear a seat belt, the participant must have a doctor‚Äôs certificate and team member must carry this approval with them when transporting those participants.</p>

                        <p><b>Mobile phones</b> <br>Team members must not use a hand-held mobile telephone whilst driving. Team members must pull over and stop the vehicle‚Äôs engine before answering or making phone calls or reading or responding to texts.</p>


                        <p><b>Speed</b><br>Team members must drive at a speed that suits the road conditions, vehicle, weather conditions and their driving experience.  Team members must not exceed the applicable speed limit for the road used. In the event a team member is issued with an infringement notice while driving a company owned vehicle, the team member will be nominated as the responsible driver and will be accountable for payment of the infringement and any demerit points.</p>


                        <p><b>Participant transport</b><br>Team members should undertake a risk assessment to determine if a participant can be transported alone in a vehicle.  Generally, participants with behaviours of concern should not be seated behind the driver and must wear a seat belt.  Team members must consider how best to transfer mobility restricted participants or handling wheelchairs or equipment, using good manual handling techniques to prevent an injury.</p>

                    <p><b>Financial management guidelines</b><br>At times, participants may require assistance with their finances, e.g., paying bills, banking or shopping. Team members must follow guidelines and procedures outlined below when financially assisting a participant:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Team members are at <strong>no time</strong> allowed access to a participant‚Äôs personal identification number (PIN) unless written permission is provided by the participant. </li>
                            <li>Transaction receipts must be obtained and provided to the participant for the following:
                                <ul>

                            <li>The team member must be sure to count the money in front of the participant on receipt and return</li>
                            <li>Team members must record all financial transactions carried out for a participant in the Financial Transaction Record and recorded in the participant‚Äôs progress notes. Records must be documented clearly, accurately and immediately</li>
                            <li>Team members must not give financial advice to participants or their companions, or act as a witness for any legal documents</li>
                            <li>Team members must not accept money or gifts from participants.</li>

                        <li>Ensuring that the participant is aware of their right to refuse people access to their funds or personal money</li>
                        <li>Encouraging the participant to ask for help if they are overwhelmed, confused, or feel they are being taken advantage of</li>

                    </p>


                    <p>If any team member suspects that a participant is being financially abused, then the following steps are to be taken: 

                        <ol>
                            <li>The team member is to gather evidence and record in participant's notes</li>

                            <li>The Program Manager will gather the details of the abuse and report to the Managing Directors.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>The Managing Directors will  make a report to relevant authorities for example the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission through Incident Reporting.</p>

This information must be no more than three (3) months old.
                    Decent Care (with the participant, carer or advocate's consent) will liaise with the family or support network, general practitioner, pharmacist, registered nurse, or an enrolled nurse to clarify aspects of the medication management, if it is unclear.  The following principles are to be followed when administering all medication including topical medications, inhaled medications, and eye drops:

                    <p><b>PRN Medication/Chemical Restraint (Behaviour Support Plans)</b><br>Team members are to consult with the Support Services Program Manager before administering PRN Medications. Where a participant has a behaviour support plan in place PRN medications are only to be administered in line with the plan as a last resort after consulting the Support Services Program Manager.</p>

                    <p><b>Safety</b><br>Participants are to be observed for any changes to their health status and, if noted, reported straight to the Support Services Program Manager who seeks the advice of a professional. 
                    Where a participant refuses the administration of medication, the Support Services Program Manager is to be advised. Relevant health professionals, i.e., doctor, registered or enrolled nurse, will be consulted where necessary.
                    Team members will not decide to withhold a participant‚Äôs medication unless certain about the participant‚Äôs health status. Team members must consult with a Support Services Program Manager before withholding medication and follow the Support Services Program Manager decision, in consultation with relevant health professionals, e.g., doctor, RN or EN. 
                    Where a participant is required to carry emergency medication for outings, the support worker must place the medication in a locked case. If a support worker does not remember the medication, it could result in disciplinary action.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Documentation</b><br>At the initial intake of a participant two documents must be completed including: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	A Medication Administration Consent form that includes the participant‚Äôs consent to be assisted and for the administrator to contact the dispenser if there are adverse reactions </li>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	Medication Schedule and Administration Chart which contains all details about the medication administration requirements. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>The medication administration chart will be held in a medication folder located in the respite accommodation office and a copy held on the participant‚Äôs file. On completion of stay the medication administration chart is to be scanned through to the participant‚Äôs file. 
                    Team members are to record each participant‚Äôs administration on the participant medication chart. This includes the date and time of medication administration along with their signature and printed name. 
                    Team members must record any changes to medication or health issues in the participant‚Äôs file notes and follow up with the Support Services Program Manager who will contact the relevant person, carer or pharmacist for any additional information that may be required. 
                    Any medication errors are to be recorded on an Incident Report Form. This will be recorded on the Incident Register and be reviewed by the Managing Directors for continuous improvement processes. 
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Adverse drug reactions </b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adverse drug reactions must be actioned immediately in line with Incident Management Procedures </li>
                            <li>This must then be reported immediately to the Support Services Program Manager</li>
                            <li>The Support Services Program Manager will inform the general practitioner/nurse immediately and document actions taken in the participant's health record</li>
                            <li>An adverse drug reaction is an incident and must be recorded on an Incident Form and in the participant‚Äôs health record, including symptoms and actions taken. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Medication disposal</b><br>All unused medication is to be disposed of by returning to a pharmacy who undertakes an incineration process to prevent medication from cycling back into the water supply. </p>

                    <p><b>Team members training for medication assistance  </b><br>Team members involved in assisting or supporting participants with their medication are trained in the steps to take in the event of an incident involving medication and understand the side-effects of medication. Decent Care will ensure that all team members hold current first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) qualifications, so they can correctly respond when monitoring any adverse reactions that require action, intervention, and escalation. 
                    Team members have relevant skills and experience, and a level of competency, to provide appropriate and safe support to a person with a disability. 
                    Decent Care‚Äôs team members participate in regular supervision by the Support Services Program Manager to affirm their knowledge and practice. The Service Manager will monitor expiry dates of training. Details will be recorded in team members files, where appropriate

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care management and team members ensure that all meals that are prepared for participants in line with the framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (World Health Organisation), that is incorporated into mealtime management practices.  
                    Decent Care recognise that people with disabilities frequently have associated disorders that interfere with nutrition in terms of intake, digestion or absorption of nutrients. They often require assistance from others for nutritional planning, and some are dependent on others for eating and drinking. 
                    </p>
                </div>


                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Scope </h2>
                    <p>This policy applies to team members and any person representing Decent Care who are providing meals or supporting participants with meal preparation. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Principles</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care is committed to ensuring they meet the NDIS Legislation Amendment Quality Indicators by ensuring that each participant requiring mealtime management receives meals that are nutritious, and of a texture that is appropriate to their individual needs, appropriately planned, and prepared in an environment and manner that meets their individual needs and preferences. Meals are delivered in a way that is appropriate to their individual needs and ensures meals are enjoyable. This is achieved through:

                        <ul>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	identifying each participant that requires mealtime management.</li>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	Ensuring each participant requiring mealtime management has their individual mealtime management needs assessed by appropriately qualified health practitioners, including by practitioners:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>undertaking comprehensive assessments of their nutrition and swallowing; and</li>
                                    <li>assessing their seating and positioning requirements for eating and drinking; and</li>
                                    <li>providing mealtime management plans which outline their mealtime management needs, including for swallowing, eating and drinking; and</li>
                                    <li>reviewing assessments and plans annually or in accordance with the professional advice of the participant‚Äôs practitioner, or more frequently if needs change or difficulty is observed.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>With their consent, each participant requiring mealtime management is involved in the assessment and development of their mealtime management plans. Each team member responsible for providing mealtime management to participants understands the mealtime management needs of those participants and the steps to take if safety incidents occur during meals, such as coughing or choking on food or fluids.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>

                    <p>Where it is identified that a participant may be experiencing difficulty or have specific nutritional requirements, Decent Care will seek a mealtime management plan. The assessment and planning will be conducted by an appropriately qualified practitioner and in partnership with the participant where consent is provided. Assessment and planning will include the following factors: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Participant preferences including their likes and dislikes</li>
                            <li>Specific nutritional requirements</li>
                            <li>Positioning needs</li>
                            <li>Food/fluid consistencies</li>
                            <li>Equipment needs</li>
                            <li>Communication needs</li>
                            <li>Environmental needs </li>
                            <li>Social connectedness opportunities</li>
                            <li>Considerations when eating out</li>
                            <li>Risks and management strategies</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Mealtime Management is included in participants files, which is easily accessible by all team members who administer the plan. </p>

                    <p><b>Team member Training in relation to individual participant mealtime plans:</b><br>Team members who provide mealtime management to participants are provided with information and understand the mealtime management needs of the individual participant. Team members will also understand the specific steps to take if safety incidents occur during meals, such as coughing or choking on food or fluids. This information will also be documented in the mealtime risk management plan. 
                    Where a participant has a mealtime plan, information regarding the requirements will be accessible to all team members who are administering the plan for easy reference at all times. 
                     </p>

                     <p><b>Preparation of texture modified foods:</b><br>
                        Team members who are required to provide texture modified foods will ensure the appropriate equipment, including a temperature probe are available to them when undertaking this role. Texture modified meals are provided for participants that have difficulty chewing and swallowing. Texture modified foods may be thickened, minced or pureed. Due to the extra handling involved with the preparation of texture modified foods, there is an increased potential for cross contamination and cases of foodborne illness have been attributed to hygiene failure during this process.  The following steps must be adhered to:</p>

                        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Cleaning and sanitising equipment</p>
                        <p>The equipment used will include a procedure or set of work instructions that outline the dismantling, cleaning and sanitising of equipment. Equipment used to homogenise food usually requires complete disassembly to fully clean. Contamination of blenders and mixers has been identified as a potential problem because they are difficult to clean.</p>

                        <p>

                                <li>All team members must wash hands thoroughly with soap and warm water and dry thoroughly ‚Äì clean gloves may be used as an additional barrier.</li>

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care is responsible for the health and safety of their team members and participants. Due to the nature of the services provided there is a risk that team members and participants will be exposed to an infectious disease.
                    Decent Care Infection Control and Prevention Policy outlines the strategies and procedures that are in place to prevent the transmission of infections between team members and participants.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Scope</h2>
                    <p>The policy applies to all team members, students, volunteers, and contractors who work with participants.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Principles </h2>
                    <p>Infectious agents cause disease or illness to their hosts. Infection control is the prevention of the transmission of infectious agents and managing infections if they occur. The most common forms of transmission are contact, droplet, blood borne, and air borne. 
                    Standard precautions are work practices that provide the first line approach to infection prevention, they should be adopted by all team members working with participants. Standard precautions should be applied in all settings regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status. Standard precautions are used to reduce or prevent the transmission of infectious agents and to render and maintain objects and healthcare areas as free as possible from infectious agents.
                    </p>
                </div>


                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Policy</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care will ensure infection control strategies and procedures are trained out to all team members. Decent Care will ensure that appropriate PPE will be supplied to team members and they are trained in its use. Decent Care will ensure that infection control strategies and procedures are regularly assessed and consistent with current best practice and relevant guidelines and standards. Records of infection control activities are maintained, including infection control training. Any incidents raised in relation to infection control issues will be reviewed and if necessary, actions will be implemented to ensure the incident does not reoccur, affected team members will be given the opportunity to debrief if required. Infection control risks will be identified; strategies will be developed and implemented for the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Hand hygiene</h2>
                    <p>Hand hygiene is the single most effective action to reduce health care associated infections. It is the simple action of hand cleansing and when performed correctly results in a reduction of microorganisms on hands.

                        <ul>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	Hands can be cleaned with soap and water or alcohol based handrub</li>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	Alcohol based hand rub can be used where hands are visibly clean</li>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	Wash with soap and water where hands are visibly soiled</li>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	Wash hands before eating and after going to the bathroom</li>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	Wash hands between care for participants.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>See Appendix 1 for WHO posters on how to Handrub and how to hand wash.
                        WHO recommends using the 5 moments of hand hygiene as the guide as to when hand hygiene should be performed in a care setting.
                        </p>


                    <p><b>Personal protective equipment (PPE)</b><br>All team members whom provide direct support to participants is able to access PPE from Decent Care. This is also available to participants for the duration of time of which the team member is providing support. </p>
                    <p>Personal protective equipment is equipment that provides a barrier between the team members and the participant items include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gloves</li>
                            <li>Protective eyewear</li>
                            <li>Face masks</li>
                            <li>Plastic aprons or gowns.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>PPE should be utilised where there is a possibility of sprays or spills or exposure to blood or body substances during a procedure. Examples may include wearing, wearing gloves when changing a dressing or changing a bed that has body fluids contaminating it. Gloves should be changed after every procedure and in between care occurring between participants. Gloves do not replace hand washing: hand washing should be completed after removing gloves.
                    Glasses and goggles are reusable and can be wiped down after use.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Cleaning of shared participant equipment </b><br>Any equipment that is shared by participants must be wiped down with a detergent solution between use.</p>
                    <p><b>Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette</b><br>Team members should cough or sneeze into a tissue or their elbow and always wash hands after this has occurred. Covering sneezes and coughs prevents people who are infected from dispersing droplets into the air where they can spread to others.</p>
                    <p><b>Routine environmental cleaning</b><br>All team members who support participants must ensure standard precautions are implemented throughout all settings in which support is provided to participants. 
                    When delivering support to participants, team members are required to maintain work areas in a clean condition, regularly wipe down frequently touched surfaces with disinfectant and with warm water and mild detergent. They must keep cleaning equipment in good working order and ensure floors are in a clean condition, no signs of visible dirt and mopped/ vacuumed regularly.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Safe handling and disposal of waste and used linen safely</b><br>See Management of Waste Policy for management and disposal of waste.
                    Used linen should be handled carefully, to avoid spreading infectious agents into the environment or onto team members clothing. Do not carry soiled linen, take the linen basket to the bedside. Wash with hot water and detergent.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Infectious disease outbreak management</b><br>An outbreak can be defined as: "when there are more cases of infection with the same organism than would normally be expected in one area or period of time". 
                    https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/health-advice/public-health/preventing-infection 
                    In the event of an outbreak in a shared accommodation facility, infected participants should be isolated. Relevant medical practitioners and health authorities should be notified. Further information can be found in the government publication ‚ÄúThe Blue Book‚Äù  
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Team member suspected illness and vaccination </b><br>Team Members must not present for their shift if they are known to have an infectious illness. They may return to work once they are symptom free or they have a certificate of clearance from their medical practitioner. Any team members presenting with signs and symptoms of an infectious disease may be sent home by management.
                    In the event of Gastroenteritis team members may not return to work until they have been symptom free for over 48 hours after all symptoms have resolved.
                    Participants attending day programs should remain home until well.
                    Consideration should be given to support workers that work within supported accommodation, day program setting where there is a risk of a splash or spill from body fluids to be vaccinated.
                    </p>
                    <p>Recommended vaccinations include:</p>

                    <div class="section">
                        <h2>Introduction </h2>
                        <p>Decent Care is responsible for the health and safety of their team members and participants. Due to the nature of the services provided, there is increased exposure to Covid-19 Virus and hence, increased risk to the safety of team members and participants. The Decent Care Covid-19 Pandemic Prevention and Management Policy outlines the strategies and procedures that are in place to prevent the transmission of infections between team members and participants.</p>

                        <h2>Procedure</h2>
                        <p><b>Notifying the NDIS Commission of certain events </b> <br>As a condition of registration with the NDIS Commission, Decent Care will notify them of changes or events that adversely affect their ability to deliver supports and services to NDIS participants using the     
                        <a href="https://www.ndiscommission.gov.au/providers/notice-changes-events/notification-covid-19">Notification of event ‚Äì COVID-19 (registered provider) form.</a></p>

                        <p>This includes any change or event that: <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Significantly affects the ability to comply with conditions of registration and the NDIS Practice Standards</li>
                                <li>Seriously impairs ability to effectively conduct operations and deliver ongoing supports or services to NDIS participants </li>
                                <li>Adversely affects a person with disability to gain access to the supports or services that Decent Care are registered to deliver. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>Notification will be made to the NDIS Commission of any changes to the scale of operations by emailing registrations@ndiscommission.gov.au, calling 1800 035 544 or completing the Notification of changes or events form ‚Äì COVID19 (registered providers) on the NDIS Commission website.</p>

                        <p><b>Risk Management </b><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Decent Care will undertake a risk assessment of the supports and services that are provided. This includes the degree to which NDIS participants rely on the supports and services to meet their daily living needs, and the extent to which their health and safety would be affected, should those services be disrupted. </li>
                                <li>Understand the specific needs of each participant and how they would like to receive information. Understand how this would be impacted if changes were made to existing service and support arrangements</li>
                                <li>Ensure participant records are up-to-date and accessible, so that their support needs and preferences are clear, documented, and available should new or temporary team member be required to support them. Records might include participants preferred means of communication, specific needs and preferences, health care plans, behaviour support plans, their representatives and information of other support providers</li>
                                <li>If possible, understand any informal supports and services that may be available to the person with disability.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Communicate effectively </b><br>Decent Care will ensure all stakeholders are aware of their roles and responsibilities under the plan. This will occur through:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Familiarising team member and any third parties with the business continuity arrangements (See Business Continuity Emergency Management  Plan and Covid-19 Plan)</li>
                                <li>Familiarising team members with policies, procedures, and responsibilities regarding infection control</li>
                                <li>Make sure clear communication channels are in place with all NDIS participants that Decent Care supports. This will enable the effective communication of any changes that might be required to a participant‚Äôs supports and services. Where Government restrictions limit public gatherings and closure of certain facilities and businesses, exploration of alternatives for activities or supports that must be ceased or adjusted must be considered.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Strategies to prepare for potential organisational outbreak include: </b><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Having leave entitlements to ensure that all team members, regardless of their employment status, can access leave to allow them to self-isolate if required.</li>
                                <li>Temporary changes have been made to awards (including to the Social, Community, Home Care and Disability Services Industry Award 2010) to include a minimum entitlement of 2 weeks unpaid pandemic leave </li>
                                <li>Maintaining an up-to-date contact list of all team members, including casual or agency team members. The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) has links for platforms who match providers with new or backup support workers, streamlining the on boarding of new team members to maintain health, wellbeing, and safety, and avoid risk of harm</li>
                                <li>Ensure all team members have updated training in infection control procedures, including standard precautions (hand hygiene, correct use of appropriate PPE where needed (and disposal procedures), and cough and sneeze etiquette) and transmission-based precautions (contact and droplet precautions)</li>
                                <li>Ensure all team members have undertaken the Department of Health COVID-19 infection control training</li>
                                <li>Implement standard infection control precautions  </li>
                                <li>Establish communication channels to keep team members informed of any updates or changes to business processes as a result of the outbreak. This includes contracted or agency team member, such as cleaners</li>
                                <li>Undertake a stocktake of consumables and source additional supplies if necessary. This could include compiling an ‚Äòoutbreak kit‚Äô with items such as: 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>personal protective equipment </li>
                                        <li>hand hygiene products (hand sanitiser, liquid soap) </li>
                                        <li>cleaning supplies  </li>
                                        <li>other essential supplies such as toilet paper and food. </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Plan for increased environmental cleaning, including where additional cleaners and oversight is required </li>
                                <li>Identify any participants who have advance care or healthcare or support plans and keep a copy if possible. Additionally, prepare a hospital bag with things they might need for an overnight stay</li>
                                <li>Develop an emergency plan for participants. This should contain details of the participant‚Äôs emergency contacts (e.g. family, guardian or advocate), current GP, any medical conditions as well as ongoing treatment and current medications, including dose and frequency</li>
                                <li>Where in-home support is provided to participants, team members should: 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>consider how the service would monitor their safety and wellbeing if they could not receive services temporarily </li>
                                        <li>make a record of participants who can only be contacted by a face-to-face visit (that is, if they cannot use the phone independently) </li>
                                        <li>give the participant and their family, guardian, or advocate contact details of someone they can call if there is a change to their health condition or circumstances (such as, if they develop symptoms, are in self-isolation or have been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Criteria for when team members should not come to work or have contact with participants</b><br>All team members should take reasonable precautions to continue to provide supports and services in a safe and competent manner with care and skill and to keep themselves and others safe.
                        Team members must not go to work if they have:
                        <ul>
                            <li>a fever, or even mild symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, sore throat,</li>
                            <li>runny nose or nasal congestion, tiredness or loss of smell or taste</li>
                            <li>returned from overseas or interstate in the last 14 days</li>
                            <li>been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>If a team member experiences even mild symptoms of respiratory illness (such as those outlined above), they must report those symptoms to their Team Leader. If they experience any of these symptoms for the first time during a shift, they should leave work as soon as practicable, report their symptoms as identified above, get tested for COVID-19, and seek medical advice from their doctor or call the National Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 020 080.</p>
                        <p><b>Training</b><br>Decent Care team members will be trained in this policy and access an online training module. The training covers the fundamentals of infection prevention and control (IPC) for COVID-19.</p>
