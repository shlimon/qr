                    Policies and Procedures

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Decent Care was established in 2019 by Arsen Nikola and Adel Dafla. Two Directors who brought together their passion for supporting people with disabilities to provide meaningful  support to participants of the NDIS.  Decent Care provides culturally sensitive, flexible, quality and local  services to participants in the Southeast Melbourne area. The Decent Care motto is ‚Äúa chance for a better future‚Äù. Decent Care strive to ensure that all participants are supported to live their best lives, creating opportunities for developing participants independence and decision making.</p>                
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>The NDIS Act</h2>
                <p>
                    The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018C00276">National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (NDIS Act; external) (External website)</a> is the legislation which establishes:
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>The National Disability Insurance Scheme, and</li>
                        <li>The National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency (known as the National Disability Insurance Agency or NDIA).
                            Among other things, the NDIS sets out:
                            </li>
                        <li>The objects and principles under which the NDIS will operate</li>
                        <li>How a person can become a participant in the NDIS</li>
                        <li>How a participant‚Äôs individual, goal-based plan is prepared and reviewed, including how the NDIA approves the funding of reasonable and necessary supports</li>
                        <li>How a provider can become a registered provider of supports</li>
                        <li>The governance arrangements for the NDIA, including its Managing Directors, Board, Independent Advisory Council, and Actuaries</li>
                        <li>A process for internal and external review of certain decisions made under the NDIS Act.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>As required under Section 208 of the NDIS Act, the Australian Government commissioned <a href="https://www.dss.gov.au/disability-and-carers/programmes-services/for-people-with-disability/national-disability-insurance-scheme/independent-review-of-the-ndis-act">an independent review of the NDIS Act (external) (External website)</a>, which was conducted by Ernst & Young (EY) between September and December 2015.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="section">
                <h2>The NDIS Rules</h2>

                    </p>
                    <p>The intention of Decent Care is that all participants and related community will have full opportunity for input over the development and review of these policies and procedures, through representation via Participant Surveys, reviews, surveys, evaluations, complaints and both formal and informal communication.</p>
                    <p>Decent Care‚Äôs policies and procedures provide the framework that must guide the actions and initiatives of all team members. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What are policies and procedures?</h2>
                <p>A policy is a statement of a service‚Äôs philosophy or general approach to an issue. A procedure describes the way in which the particular issue will be addressed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Why are policies and procedures important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Clearly written policies and procedures are essential in achieving consistent, quality service delivery for a number of reasons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>They provide clear guidance to current and future participants in relation to the type and quality of service they can expect to achieve</li>
                        <li>They provide clear guidance to team members as to what is expected of them in various situations</li>
                        <li>They provide a focus for Decent Care and implementing any changes in the way the service is provided; and</li>
                        <li>Unwritten policies may be forgotten or confused when key team members resign or are absent, leading to confusion, inconsistency, lack of direction, and/or duplication of effort and may put participants or team members at risk.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                
                <p>The primary purpose of policies and procedures is to provide an agreed, documented framework within which consistently high-quality services are delivered.
                    In line with the NDIS Practice Standards, the policies and procedures have been developed to meet the requirements of the following divisions of the Core Module.

        <div class="heading">
            <h1>NDIS Code of Conduct</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <p>Decent Care has adopted the underpinning principles of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) Code of Conduct (the Code) as set out in the National Disability Insurance Scheme (Code of Conduct) Rules 2018.</p> 
            <p>The obligations in the Code are fundamental to the rights of people with disability set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
            Decent Care respects and supports the fundamental rights of participants to continue living independently in their own homes and communities with dignity and respect, along with choice and inclusion concerning their support needs and being free to engage an advocate and/or representative of their choice. </p>    
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>The Managing Directors in addition to all team members, contractors and students are required to refer to the policies outlined in the manual throughout their work, as they govern our operations and service delivery. They are expected to uphold the Policy Manual's content and raise any questions or issues.  Related policies and procedures should be read in conjunction with this policy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Code</h2>
            <p>This Code of Conduct sets out, in principle, the behaviours and standards of conduct expected of management, team members and students of the organisation who are providing support and services to a person and to uphold the rights of all participants. </p>

            <p>By offering services to participants, Decent Care always will strive to:  
                <b>Act with respect for individual rights to freedom of expression, self-determination and decision-making in accordance with applicable laws and conventions</b>
                Supporting people with disability to have the right to make their own decisions, to be free to live the life they choose and to have the same rights and freedoms as any other member of the community. All Decent Care team members undertake to understand and educate others that people with disability have full and equal human rights, debunking the historical portrayal of them being dependent, helpless and in need of care and protection.
                </p>

                <p><b >Decent Care will deliver services in a way that maintains the standards and principles that underpin the NDIS </b><br>
                    By delivering supports and services in accordance with the NDIS rules made under the NDIS Act (2013), Decent Care will maintain the standards and principles and uphold the conventions that underpin the NDIS. This includes the principle of the United Nations Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities as well as other international human rights treaties named in the NDIS Act. 
                    Decent Care will also comply with the National Disability Insurance Scheme (Provider Registration and Practice Standards) Rules 2018, which has been developed in line with the National Standards for Disability Services and the National Standards for Mental Health Services.
                </p>

                <p><b>Decent Care will support people with disability to make decisions </b>
                <br>
                Decent Care will support the right to freedom of expression and the right to make decisions about and exercise control over, their own lives. Decent Care ensures people with disability have the right to choice and control about who supports them and how their supports are delivered. They will support people with disability to make decisions by directly engaging with people on any choices or decisions that affect them. People with disability will be consulted about who, if anyone, they want to involve in decisions and discussions about their services and supports, or other aspects of their life.  When a legal guardian or nominee is present, Decent Care will strive to be clear on the decision of which they need to involve them in decision making. However, Decent Care will ensure they listen and support the person to make their own decisions and undertake a Supported Decision-Making model when appropriate.
                </p>
    
                <p><b>Decent Care will communicate in a form, language and manner that enables people with disability to understand the information and make known their will and preferences </b><br>
                    Decent Care supports the right for people with disability to question, seek additional information on, or refuse to receive any part of service.  
                    Decent Care will deliver this by: 
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Communicating in a form, language and manner that is accessible and appropriate for the individual and to use a range of communication tools to communicate with people being supported, using assistive technology and alternative forms of communication such as email, text messages or symbols. </li>

                        <li>Where a person speaks a language other than English or uses Auslan, match the person with a team member who speaks their language or uses Auslan (where possible) or provide supports using qualified interpreters, where these supports are covered by their NDIS plan. </li>


                        <li>Confirm that the person with disability and their families, carer or advocates (where relevant) understand what has been explained and are aware of the potential benefits and risks associated with any part of a proposed plan for the delivery of supports and services. </li>

                        <li>
                            Respond to the will, preferences and concerns of the person with disability in relation to their supports and services ‚Äì addressing requests or complaints where necessary. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Where possible, provide consistent team members, so that they can build a good understanding of individual communication preferences and needs, particularly where an individual has complex communication needs. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>


                <p><b>Respect the privacy of people with disability </b><br>Decent Care will comply with State and Territory privacy laws.

                        <h1>Advocacy Policy and Procedures</h1>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Decent Care is committed to pursuing the rights and principles of equality, independence, choice and inclusion that underpin a person- centred philosophy.
                In achieving this goal, Decent Care acknowledge that some participants may need assistance to understand issues fully and to voice individual needs and concerns. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the National Disability Strategy promotes social and economic inclusion for people with disability. The availability of high quality, accurate, appropriate and timely information is a key determinant of how well a person can plan and make decisions that affect their lives. Decent Care recognises and supports that participants have the right to choose to involve an advocate to act on their behalf and promote, protect and ensure their full and equal enjoyment of all human rights enabling community participation.
                The purpose of this policy is to provide an overarching framework for recognition and engagement with advocates who are working with participants to ensure that the rights and wishes of the individual are adequately informed and at the centre of the decision-making process.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Scope</h2>
                <p>This policy applies to all Management, team members and any other person who represents Decent Care. </p>
            </div>


            <div class="section">
                <h2>Principles</h2>
                <p>Decent Care recognises that for a person to lead an inclusive life they may require their family, friends, colleagues and other important people in their life to have access to information so they can better support and interact to achieve real social inclusion.  In order to exercise choice and maximise independence, people require access to accurate information that will help them manage their own lives, understand their options, manage issues and grievances, access community, and engage on topics of interest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Policy</h2>
                <p>Decent Care acknowledges that any participant of the service has the right to seek support of an advocate or advocacy agency to help them with all aspects of service delivery provided by Decent Care or from other providers.
                    Whenever possible participants will be supported and encouraged to self-advocate however, Decent Care will facilitate access for a participant to use an advocate should they wish Decent Care to do so.
                    It is acknowledged that at times Decent Care team members will be asked to attend meetings in a professional capacity to present information on behalf of the participant. In these circumstances it is expected that this representation will be restricted to senior team member positions.
                    Decent Care will not disclose any information about the participant to an advocate, when the participant is not present, unless the participant has given express permission to do so. If a participant wishes the organisation to disclose information to an advocate, they will be required to disclose this information in writing. 
                    </p>

                <h2>Procedure</h2>
                <p><b>Advocacy in relation to Decent Care</b><br>
                    At first point of contact, participants will be advised of their right to have someone represent their interest and to assist them with part or all aspects of their service delivery, including planning, review, complaints and incidents. 
                    Contact details for advocates are listed in their Participant Welcome Pack.

                    <p><b>Emergency response</b> <br>Team members who are present at the time of the assault will: <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Take appropriate measures to maintain their own safety, and that of other participants and team members</li>

                        <li>Contact the local Sexual Assault Service if a person has been sexually assaulted</li>
                        <li>If the matter involves a person under the age of 18 years, concerns are to be reported about the immediate safety of a child to: <b>Deptarment of Health and Human Services: 1300 655795 (Vic)</b></li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Team members at the scene must endeavour to ensure that any evidence the Police may require in their investigation is not disturbed</li>
                        <li>Evidence may be lost if a victim of sexual assault bathes soon after the assault. Try to delay bathing until the Police arrive if the victim is not distressed about the delay</li>
                        <li>If possible, preserve the victim‚Äôs clothing as evidence following an assault of any type</li>
                        <li>If possible, isolate the area where the incident occurred and do not allow anyone to enter the area until the Police arrive</li>
                        <li>Apart from ascertaining their physical condition and state of mind, avoid questioning the person about the incident to reduce contamination of their recall and confusion about the events.</li>

                        <li>Any allegations of abuse by a team member towards a participant will be the subject of internal investigations within Decent Care and the Police</li>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Principles</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care aims to provide ethical services with integrity that provides participants and their careers with assurance and transparency in relation to any perceived or real conflict of interest.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Policy</h2>
                    <p>This policy has been developed to provide direction to address actual or perceived conflicts of interest affecting Decent Care and their participants. 
                    It is the policy of Decent Care as well as a responsibility of team members, that ethical, legal, financial or other conflicts of interest be avoided and that any such conflicts (where they do arise) do not conflict with professional or organisational obligations. This will be conducted by ensuring that:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Organisational or ethical values do not impede a participant‚Äôs right to choice and control</li>
                        <li>As individual conflicts arise, they are identified, reported, acted upon, and analysed </li>
                        <li>Advice to a participant about support options is transparent and provides all opportunities </li>
                        <li>All participants are treated equally, and that no participant is given preferential treatment above another in the receipt of provision of supports.</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p><b>Decent Care will manage conflicts of interest by requiring team members to: </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remain aware of the potential for conflicts of interest to arise which may affect their ability to exercise professional discretion and unbiased judgment</li>
                        <li>Avoid conflicts of interest where possible</li>
                        <li>Do not provide financial advice to participants at any time</li>
                        <li>Identify and disclose any conflicts of interest</li>
                        <li>Consult with their Program Manager where potential conflicts of interest do arise to find an appropriate resolution</li>
                        <li>Carefully manage any conflicts of interest where they have been reported and analysed</li>
                        <li>Follow this policy and respond to any breaches</li>
                    </ul></p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>

                    <p><b>Identification and disclosure of conflicts of interest</b> <br>Once an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest is identified, a Conflict-of-Interest Form must be completed (through the QR Code) by the person declaring the conflict within 24-hours.  The declared conflict of interest will then be entered onto the Conflict-of-Interest Register. <br> <br>
                    The Conflict-of-Interest Register must be maintained by the Managing Directors. The register must record all information related to a conflict of interest (including the nature and extent of the conflict of interest and any steps taken to address it). </p>


                    <p><b>Action required to manage conflicts of interest</b>In deciding what approach to take, the Program Manager and where required the Managing Director of Operations and discloser will consider: <ul>
                        <li>Whether the conflict needs to be avoided or simply documented </li>
                        <li>Whether the conflict will realistically impair the disclosing person‚Äôs competency and capacity to impartially participate in decision-making </li>
                        <li>Alternative options to avoid the conflict </li>
                        <li>If accepted, what management strategies will be undertaken </li>
                        <li>Decent Care‚Äôs resources </li>
                        <li>The possibility of creating an appearance of improper conduct that might impair confidence in, or the reputation of, the business. </li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>The action and result of the decision will be recorded in the Conflict of Interest Register for future reference.</p>

                    <p><b>Multiple relationships</b><br>A multiple or dual relationship is a situation where multiple roles exist between a team member and a participant. Multiple relationships can occur when: a personal and professional relationship exists between a team member and participant, when a team member has a professional or personal relationship with a person closely related or connected to the participant, or when multiple professional relationships exist between the team members and participant e.g. support worker and support coordinator.  
                    Decent Care team members should avoid engaging in multiple relationships that may impair their competence, effectiveness or objectivity. 
                    Where multiple relationships with participants are unavoidable due to over-riding ethical considerations, organisational requirements, or by law, team members will:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Declare the multiple relationships using the Conflict-of-Interest Form</li>
                        <li>Consult with their Program Manager to attempt to find an appropriate resolution that is in the best interest of all involved parties.</li>
                        <li>Clarify professional boundaries with the participant from the outset of the professional relationship.</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p><b>Multiple support that includes Plan Management and Support Coordination </b><br>Decent Care maintain three distinct programs within their service provision including support coordination, support services and plan management with a Program Manager overseeing each program. Participant information is stored within each programs CRM and can only be accessed by team members working within the program of supports they are receiving. Where a participant is accessing dual support, they will have a separate service agreement for each program and consent will be sought to share any information. <br><br>
                    When delivering Plan Management and Support Coordination, team members must only recommend and provide supports that are appropriate to the needs of participants. This means providing truthful information about the:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Capacity, qualifications, training and professional affiliations of providers and their team members</li>
                        <li>Supports, services or products delivered by providers, including Decent Care; and</li>
                        <li>Full costs of support and what these include.</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p>Information provided to support participants‚Äô decision making may include quotes, cost breakdowns for different support options; other people‚Äôs feedback about supports they‚Äôve received and the risks or different support options; other people‚Äôs feedback about supports they‚Äôve received and the risks and benefits of different supports.</p>

                    <p>Delivery of additional supports <ul>
                        <li>Decent Care must include and monitor the conflict of interest related to delivering Plan Management and/or Support Coordination along with other NDIS supports in the participant‚Äôs progress notes and report to the Managing Director of Operations where an issue emerges</li>
                        <li>The conflict of interest must be declared to all participants using Decent Care Plan Management and/or Support Coordination services, as part of their intake and assessment process through the Appendix A attached to the service agreement. Strategies to address the conflict must also be explained. Should a participant choose to use another provider because of this conflict, team members must respect their decision.</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p>Strategies that Decent Care has in place to manage the conflict of interest involved in delivering Support Coordination along with other NDIS supports include: <ul>
                        <li>Maintaining a clear separation of responsibilities between Support Coordination team members and other team members including separate reporting lines</li>
                        <li>Providing participants with the option of several providers for each type of support they are seeking</li>
                        <li>Where only one option of provider can be suggested for a particular support, thoroughly documenting the rationale for this, and reviewing it regularly</li>
                        <li>Keeping detailed records of any issues that arise with supports provided to a participant by Decent Care, including the actions taken and how the issue was resolved</li>
                        <li>Continually working with participants and other areas of Decent Care to understand how well their supports are meeting their needs and adjusting support delivery before issues emerge</li>
                        <li>Explaining the difference between Support Coordination and other supports funded in participants‚Äô NDIS plans, including the requirement that supports provided be reasonable and necessary; and</li>
                        <li>Explaining that any choice participants make about providers of other supports will not impact the provision of their Support Coordination.</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p>Strategies Decent Care has in place to manage the conflict of interest involved in delivering Plan Management along with other NDIS supports include: <ul>
                        <li>Maintaining a clear separation of responsibilities between Plan Management team members and other team members</li>
                        <li>Continually monitoring its financial practices to ensure participants‚Äô NDIS funds are accounted for separately to Decent Care funds; and</li>
                        <li>Used for the purpose they were provided and in participants‚Äô best interests.</li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>Participants must also be informed about their right to change Support Coordinators and/or Plan Managers and how they can go about doing so, as well as Decent Care feedback and complaints processes (see the Feedback and Complaints Policy). The action and result of the decision will be recorded in the Conflict of Interest Register for future reference.</p>
                    <p><b>Compliance with this policy</b><br>
                    If there is reason to believe that a person has failed to comply with the policy, then an investigation of the circumstances will be conducted.
                    If it is found that that person failed to disclose a conflict of interest, then the Managing Directors may commence disciplinary action.  
                    If a team member suspects a failure to disclose a conflict of interest, they must notify the Managing Directors, who will address it in confidence with the identified person.

                    <h2>Definition of conflicts of interests</h2>
                    <p>A conflict of interest occurs when a person‚Äôs individual interests, conflict with their responsibility to act in the best interests of the business or participant. 
                    Personal interests include direct interests, as well as those of family, friends, or other organisations a person may be involved with or have an interest in. 
                    It also includes a conflict between a team member‚Äôs duty and another duty that the team member has (for example another occupation).  A conflict of interest may be actual, potential or perceived and may be financial or non-financial. 
                    These situations present the risk that a person will make a decision based on, or affected by, these influences, rather than in the best interests of Decent Care or their participants.
                    </p>

                    <p> <strong> <em>Examples of a Conflict of Interest may include (but not limited to):</em> </strong></p>

                    <h3>Gifts and Benefits</h3>
                    <p>Decent Care management and team members must not accept any offer of money, gifts, services or benefits that would cause them to act in a manner contrary to the best interest of a participant. </p>
                    <h3>Influencing Choice and Commissions</h3>
                    <p>Decent Care will not have any financial or any other personal interest that could directly influence or compromise the choice of provider or provision of support to a participant. This includes the obtaining or offering of any form of commission.</p>
                    <h3>Referring participants to associated Providers</h3>
                    <p>Decent Care will always ensure the participant is provided options without influence when offering support options. </p>
                    <h3>Referring participants to internal service offering</h3>
                    <p>Decent Care will ensure that where a participant requires multiple supports, and one of those services is available through Decent Care, three options will be provided. </p>

                            Once a personal file for participants has been established, team members must maintain the file to ensure that all information is accurate, up-to-date and complete.
Team members must document in the participant‚Äôs file, significant issues and events that arise during their work with the participants as those events and problems occur.
As information in the personal file becomes non-current (that is, information that no longer has any bearing on the services being provided to the participant. Program Managers will establish an archival file, and progressively cull non-current information into that file for storage in a secure place. <br>
Decent Care will regularly audit the files of participants to ensure that:

                            <ul>
                                <li>The file is up to date, including that all plans are current</li>
                                <li>Ensuring that all progress notes demonstrate relationship to goal plans</li>
                                <li>All forms are being used appropriately</li>
                                <li>The progress/file notes are factual, accurate, complete and in chronological order</li>
                                <li>When a participant leaves the service their personal file will go to the archival file with authorised access.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <b>Security of files and participant information</b> <br>
                            All electronic files for participants are stored in a password protected CRM and cloud-based storage drive. All current hard copy files for participants will be kept in a secure area, in a lockable filing cabinet to ensure that only authorised team members can gain access to personal information of a participant. 
Files of participant can only be taken from the service by relevant team members from Decent Care with the approval of the Program Managers. <br>
Team members must not undertake any of the following actions without express approval:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Photocopy any confidential document, form or record</li>

                            Team members must ensure that all relevant information about the participant is entered into the participant‚Äôs file notes in a factual, accurate, complete and timely manner. The progress notes for each participant should be written whenever support has been provided or communication has occurred and when a significant event occurs that may impact future support provision. 
Whenever required, the participant should be made aware of what has been recorded in their progress/file notes.

                    <h2>Policy</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care is committed to managing complaints in a way that is accountable, transparent, timely, meaningful and the most direct way possible.
                    Any individual, stakeholder or agency wishing to lodge a complaint about services will be provided information about the complaint management process. Every complaint will be heard respectfully with a willingness to assist the complainant.
                    Information will be provided in a format that is easily understood, in an appropriate language, communicated appropriately and considered effort will be taken to ensure the complainant is fully informed about the process. Complaints may be lodged on behalf of another person, if permission been obtained. 
                    Each participant is provided with information about the use of an advocate (including an independent advocate) and access to an advocate is facilitated if the participant selects to include one. See also Decent Care Advocacy Policy and Procedure. Information is provided in the Welcome Pack along with the Service Agreement at commencement of service.
                    All personal information that Decent Care collects to manage feedback and complaints is handled in accordance with privacy legislation and the Decent Care Privacy Policy.  Decent Care takes all reasonable steps to notify the complainant before disclosing any confidential information.
                    Decent Care expects that most complaints or feedback will be addressed and responded to by the Program Managers. Where complaints require investigation or more formal review, sufficient resources are allocated to ensure that complaints are effectively and professionally managed, thoroughly investigated by suitably skilled team members who will, if required, seek guidance from the external agencies such as the NDIS Commission.

The outcome of a complaint investigation will be discussed with the complainant, where possible. This must be followed by written advice that provides the complainant an opportunity to make further contact with Decent Care if required.

                    This may include escalating the matter to an external complaints agency or seeking a further review within Decent Care. Written advice should also seek feedback from the complainant regarding their experience of the complaints process.
                    Support must be provided to assist complainants‚Äô understanding of correspondence regarding complaints where required (e.g. interpreters, referral to advocates, etc.).

                    </p>
                </div>



                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Policy</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care is committed to managing incidents in an accountable, transparent, timely and meaningful way and in the most direct way possible.
                    Any individual, stakeholder or agency wishing to report an incident in relation to Decent Care service provision will be provided with information regarding the organisations Incident Management policy and procedure. All instances will be heard respectfully and with a willingness to assist the person making the report.
                    Upon recruitment, all team members must undergo an induction process that includes training and information in relation to Decent Care incidents processes. Additional on-the-job and formal training will be provided where required.                            
                    Decent Care is committed to the following incident management principles:
                     <ul>
                        <li>Ensuring participants are aware of how Decent Care manages incidents when entering the service</li>
                        <li>Ensuring the immediate safety of participants and Decent Care team members</li>
                        <li>Identify and report incidents as soon as practicable after the event</li>
                        <li>Assist people to report an incident in whatever way is meaningful for them and in a language or communication method that is appropriate </li>
                        <li>Protect confidentiality and privacy of people affected by incidents</li>
                        <li>Investigate incidents and report fairly, objectively and professionally</li>
                        <li>Remain open and accountable in dealing with any incident; and</li>
                        <li>Integrate incident analysis information into Decent Care‚Äôs continuous improvement process.</li>
                     </ul></p>
                     <p>Decent Care‚Äôs Incident Management System provides for collection of statistical and other information relating to incidents to enable Decent Care to analyse trends, systemic issues and to report these findings to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission if required.
                     Decent Care understand that failure to comply with the incident management requirements of the NDIS legislation and rules may lead to the NDIS Commissioner taking compliance and enforcement action against the organisation.
                     </p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>
                    <p>Incident management processes are provided to the participant in the Welcome Pack in an appropriate language, terms or mode of communication. Any stakeholder wanting to report an incident report can do so. 
                    Decent Care will afford all reporters the highest standard of confidentiality.  Incident matters will only be discussed with those on a need-to-know basis and will not be a matter of discussion between any other individuals. All documentation will be retained in a secure place and in compliance with all privacy policies and legislation.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Decent Care incident triage process:</b></p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Once the initial triage has been applied, the Program Manager and Managing Director of Operations (where required) will undertake an investigation to identify the root causes and apply the appropriate remedial action.  Once an incident report is lodged an alert is sent to the Decent Care office and the incident information is entered onto the Incident Register. Correspondence regarding the outcome of the incident resolution is provided to the participant.
                    Investigation of incidents will not be conducted by a person about whom was involved in the incident.
                    </p>
                    <p>All team members will handle incidents with: <br>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Sensitivity to the needs of the participant</li>
                        <li>In a supportive manner</li>
                        <li>Efficiency and effectiveness</li>
                        <li>Timeliness</li>
                        <li>Empathy by sharing other people‚Äôs feelings and perspectives of issues involved</li>
                        <li>Communicate mindfully, and</li>
                        <li>Provide details regarding external support agencies that may assist them with complaints/incidents resolution if required.</li>
                    </ul> </p>


                    <p><b>Findings and Outcomes</b> <br>Individuals or parties with a report of an incident may make contact directly with the NDIS Quality and Safeguard Commission, should the issue remain unresolved, dealt with unsatisfactory or at any time in the management process.</p>

                    <p>Reportable incidents will be notified to the NDIS Commission within 24 hours of the event, with a more detailed report about the incident and actions taken in response to it provided within five (5) business days.
                    Any instance of unauthorised use of restrictive practice will be notified by the Program Manager to the NDIS Commission within five (5) business days of a provider‚Äôs key personnel being made aware of it. If there is harm to a participant, it will be reported within 24 hours.
                    Any updated or new information that comes to hand after the event, will be provided in writing to the Commissioner. 
                    If required, a final report will be provided within 60 business days of initial report. The NDIS Commission will advise Decent Care whether a final report is required.
                    Where a reportable incident occurs in connection with the provision of services by the provider and does not include those outlined in Appendix A, Decent Care will ensure that all internal reporting documentation is completed.
                    </p>

                    <p>In all cases, Decent Care will assess:

                            <li>The impact on the NDIS participant</li>

                            <li>What, if any, changes are required to prevent further similar events occurring.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p><b>Incident Monitoring and Review</b><br>As part of Decent Care‚Äôs commitment to quality management and continuous improvement, Decent Care maintains all incident information using the Incidents Register. Adopting a process as such assists to review service performance and progress through ensuring that the list is analysed for repeat issues enabling opportunities for identification of service improvement.
                    The register includes the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identification</li>

                        <li>Preventative action that has/will be undertaken</li>
                        <li>Incident handling improvement strategies; and</li>
                        <li>Incident handling Improvement implementation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>The register will be reviewed and updated at a minimum of once per month as part of Decent Care Managing Directors Review process or unless required sooner due to high incident occurrences. The statistical data will be provided to the NDIS Commissioner if it is deemed to be required. Records for incidents will be kept for seven (7) years in line with the NDIS (Incident Management and Reportable Incidents) Rules 2018</p>


                    <p><b>Incidents Relating to Violence, Abuse, Neglect, Exploitation and Discrimination</b><br>Decent Care takes reports of violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, and discrimination very seriously. It is mandatory for any report of abuse or neglect reported to Decent Care by team members, participants, families, carers and other stakeholders or members of the public to be reported by Decent Care to the Police and to any relevant external agency.

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>
                    <p><b>Governance Risk Management</b> <br>Decent Care Governance Framework includes a Business Continuity Plan and Emergency Plan (BCP) that provides key contacts and directions for team members to follow in the case of an emergency The BCP is tested and reviewed regularly to maintain effectiveness. Reports of testing are reviewed by the Managing Directors and remedial actions are undertaken. Testing processes include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Testing information backup systems</li>
                        <li>Testing team members knowledge</li>
                        <li>Testing participant knowledge of their personal Emergency Plans. </li>
                        <li>Seeking feedback from team members and participants about the plans in place. </li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>Furthermore, risks and associated strategies are documented in the Business Risk Management Register. See also Master Register</p>

                    <p><b>Emergency Officer </b> <br>The Emergency Plan identifies an Emergency Officer. The Emergency Officer (in this case the Managing Directors) will provide leadership and delegation in the following processes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Review the BCP</li>
                        <li>Undertake communications with Emergency Services</li>
                        <li>Review and prioritise participants based on the Vulnerability Register (see Master Register)</li>
                        <li>Undertake communications with team members ensuring that participant emergency plans are actioned</li>
                        <li>Document all actions within the BCP Incident Event Log and Incident Response Checklists</li>
                        <li>Monitor progress and team members to support participants</li>
                        <li>Seek additional support if necessary, e.g sourcing additional team members</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p><b>Participant Personal Emergency Management Plans</b> <br>Each participant who is deemed to rely on the service for daily needs undertakes Emergency Planning at the commencement of service as part of the Intake Process. 
                    The Emergency Management Plan is located within the participant file that includes the following critical information that is necessary in an emergency:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Participant Profile</li>
                        <li>Participant Goals</li>

                        <li>Any other relevant documentation </li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p>The plan is explained to the participant and their support network in a language, terms and mode of communication that will best suit their communication needs. 
                    The Emergency Officer will monitor weather conditions and implement the Emergency Management Plan prior to the event, to ensure that participants are supported during an emergency or disaster situation. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Team members must action the Personal Emergency Plan and review all other critical information e.g medical plans prior to undertaking action in an emergency.</p>
                    <p>The Managing Directors must be advised immediately by team members about any difficulties experienced in actioning the plan </p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Principles</h2>
                    <p>Goal Planning is an important component of Decent Care support process to ensure that each participant can achieve success in their chosen activities. The ‚ÄúAbout Me and My Supports‚Äù is a holistic and collaborative process that explores participants aspirations and defines their chosen activities. Goal plans are developed based on the information sourced from the About Me and My Supports Form, whilst identifying individual participant risk. Goal plans are reviewed on a regular basis to monitor outcomes as well as review and manage any risks.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Policy</h2>
                    <p>Individual planning and review processes aim to support people to move toward a more positive lifestyle through enhancing decision-making opportunities and facilitating social integration, participation, and inclusion in the community. The planning process also provides information to maintain safety and continuity of support in the event of natural disaster.</p>
                    <p>The ‚ÄúAbout Me and My Supports‚Äù provides information about all plans associated with the care of the participant as well as a guide to supporting participant needs and personal preferences. This includes where relevant:

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>
                    <p><b>Goal Planning, risk management and review process</b><br>The intake procedure provides the basis for all planning (see Intake and Transition Policy and Procedure) and serves as the ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù component of the ‚ÄúAbout me and My Supports‚Äù. The About me and My Supports Form provides information about the participant and indicates further planning requirements. The following steps should be taken when conducting support planning with participants:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Review the incoming transition form to identify previous supports and transition plan. </li>
                        <li>Review the About Me and My Supports Form and ensure all plans that are identified as required are included in the participant‚Äôs file</li>
                        <li>Considering the plans that do apply, commence the goal planning process including any health goals that have been identified. This is undertaken in collaboration with the participant, inviting them to include an advocate in the process. </li>
                        <li>Support the participant with access to current and accessible information about appropriate and accessible resources and services to help them make informed decisions and choices</li>
                        <li>Identify risks associated with goals and developing management strategies to remove or minimise the impact of the risk. Risks are reviewed regularly to ensure effectiveness</li>
                        <li>Explaining the risks and consequences in the choices being considered</li>
                        <li>Incorporate flexibility into the planning, development and review steps to capture the ongoing changing needs of participants and their families/carers, including their health needs, sexuality and self-protection requirements</li>
                        <li>On completion, ask participant if they would like a copy of the About Me and My Supports Form, Goal Plan and Emergency Plan. Once this has been provided to them, ask them (or their support person) to sign to acknowledge offer of the copy or receipt. </li>
                        <li>Enquire with participant if they would like the goal planning documents shared with family, support network or other providers.  If yes, the consent form must be signed </li>
                        <li>Where appropriate and with the participant's consent, developing and maintaining linkages through collaboration with other providers by sharing information to help meet the participant's needs</li>
                        <li>Adjust the support delivery in a reasonable way and continuously monitoring to ensure it is fit for purpose and the participant's health, privacy, quality of life and independence is supported</li>
                        <li>The goal plan document is shared with all Decent Care team members who are involved in the participants supports.  This includes ensuring each team member is trained to respond to emergencies, including how to distinguish between urgent, and non-urgent health situations</li>
                        <li>All goal plans and risk assessments are reviewed annually, or sooner if the participant circumstances change, or they request an update. </li>

                        <li>Ensuring participants are familiar with their support workers by undertaking a ‚Äúmeet and greet‚Äù process and ensuring a match prior to ongoing visits. All team members are issued with  ID cards to ensure they can be recognised as a representative of Decent Care.</li>
                        <li>Where a participant is working with other providers, Decent Care will seek consent to work collaboratively with the network to identify and manage participant risks and to correctly interpret their needs and preferences.</li>
                        <li>The communication plan provides a process for participants to express any emerging safety or health related concerns to their support team</li>
                        <li>The Emergency Plan provides escalation information to team members (see Emergency Planning Policy and Procedure)</li>
                        <li>Each team member has training (including refresher training), in infection prevention controls standard precautions including hygiene practices, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette See also infection control policy and procedure </li>
                        <li>Infection prevention and control standard precautions are implemented throughout all settings. </li>
                        <li>Each team member who provides supports directly to participants undertakes training (including refresher training) in the use and disposal of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</li>
                        <li>PPE is available to each team member, and each participant who requires it.</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p><b>Planning Principles</b></p>

                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Person at the centre</p>
                        <p>Participants are central to planning and decision-making to achieve their preferred lifestyle. The participant chooses the level of participation in planning according to her or his preference and ability and is encouraged and supported to have as much control as possible over the whole planning process.</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Considering culture</p>
                        <p>Planning takes into consideration the culture, language, religious beliefs and priorities of all people. Planning with a participant is undertaken about social customs and traditions and the individuals own culture and beliefs.</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Inclusion of others</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the person's wishes and consent, their personal support networks and other supporting service providers are actively included in the planning and review process.
                        The inclusion of others in the support planning process aims to encourage the ongoing involvement in the person's life, and to encourage and assist growth of the participant's networks and community engagement.
                        </p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Personal priorities and strengths</p>
                        <p>Intake processes include the identification of the persons strengths, including their personal networks and interests. This information is utilised to develop a capacity building approach and instil confidence in the self-delivery of the plan.</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Dignity of risk</p>
                        <p>Each participant's right to the dignity of risk in decision making is supported. When needed, each participant is supported to make informed choices about the benefits and risks of the options being considered</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Continuous process</p>
                        <p>Planning with the person at the centre is a continuous process of listening, learning and further action and is not a one-off event. Person-centred planning assumes that people with disability have futures, and that their aspirations will change and grow with their experiences.</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Consultation</p>
                        <p>Decent Care operates within a learning culture and supports that each person is the expert in their own lives. Whilst the policy draws on the expertise within Decent Care, the policy will evolve with consultation with team members, participants and their families, carers and advocates.</p>

                        <p><b>Training</b></p>
                        <p>All team members are trained in intake, assessment, goal planning, review and risk management processes as part of the induction.</p>

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care is committed to providing people with a high standard of service aimed at meeting individual needs and promoting dignity, purpose, and security. Decent Care provide a consistent and transparent approach to all people entering or exiting the service.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Principles</h2>
                    <p>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the National Disability Insurance Scheme quality standards promote access, inclusion and choice for people with disability with a focus on their individual needs, goals and aspirations. Decent Care aims to promote these principles within all aspects of intake and transition process.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Policy</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care acknowledges all people have the right to accurate, clear and transparent information when enquiring, or accessing or transitioning from the service. This information is provided to inform their decision making.
                    The intake process is undertaken to identify the individuals needs and preferences. This information is utilised to identify the plans required and to identify and manage risks associated with their supports and daily living. 
                    Transition planning supports participants who are accessing or leaving the service to do so, in a planned, communicated and risk managed way to minimise any negative impacts that may arise during the process. 
                    Decent Care acknowledges that each person has the right to refuse a service or leave Decent Care at any time they choose. Furthermore, it is acknowledged that Decent Care may discontinue a service in consultation with the person, their family and other important members of the person‚Äôs support network if the service is no longer sustainable or appropriate to the participant.
                    Decent Care is committed to working with and referring to other community services or organisations to meet the multiple needs of participants.
                    Exit procedures will be fair, transparent, follow due process and uphold the rights of participants.
                    </p>
                </div>


                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>
                    <p><b>Pre-entry</b></p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Entry criteria</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Current NDIS Plan</li>
                            <li>Require the services that are provided under Decent Care service provision</li>
                            <li>Are geographically placed to receive services (or have the appropriate technology). </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Initial Meeting</b> <br>On entry to the service, an initial meeting will be arranged with the participant, their family/carers and other significant people from their support network This may take place at the person‚Äôs home, or other suitable community venue. The initial meeting provides an opportunity to further discuss the participant needs and to review any documentation available, including a transition form from a previous provider, if available. 
                    Where a person provides their NDIS Plan, Decent Care will determine if the organisation is able to deliver the specific supports detailed. If the NDIS Plan has not been provided, Decent Care will request the participant‚Äôs NDIS Participant Number (for Agency Managed participants). Decent Care acknowledges that participants do not have to provide their NDIS Plan if they do not wish to. 
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Welcome pack </b>The participant will receive a Welcome Pack explaining their rights while receiving supports from Decent Care. This information is discussed in a format that best meets the participants communication needs.</p>

                    <p><b>The service agreement</b><br>Service agreements are developed in collaboration with the participant where all components of the agreement are discussed. This includes what services will be provided and how often.  All costs associated with the delivery of service are clearly detailed outlining the amount per hour and total budgeted cost for the period
                    The service agreement is signed by both parties, and the participant is provided a copy of the agreement. In the instance where the participant is unable to sign, and a representative is not present, a note will be made outlining the circumstances under why this occurred. A service agreement is created for each program the participant is accessing from Decent Care (e.g. Support Coordination, Support Services, Plan Management), to manage conflict of interest involved in providing multiple support.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>About Me and My Supports (Intake and Assessment)</b> <br>All participants who enter the service will, in collaboration with the relevant Program Manager, complete an About Me and My Supports Form. The information informs and determines the goal planning activities and service provision and ensures that the participant is receiving supports in line with their needs and preferences.</p>

                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Personal preferences</p>
                    <p>The About Me and My Support Form identifies the individuals‚Äô personal needs and preferences to ensure a person-centred approach is provided in the delivery of services. This information includes the participants: <ul>
                        <li>Personal details</li>
                        <li>Support Network</li>
                        <li>Cultural Background</li>
                        <li>Daily Activity</li>
                        <li>Likes/dislikes</li>
                        <li>Preferred team member characteristics (male/female, age, specific interests)</li>
                        <li>Communication needs </li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Specialised Plans required</p>
                    <p>The About Me and My Supports Form identifies which plans will be required in order to effectively support the participant. These plans ensure comprehensive supports are provided. </p>
                    <p>Where identified, this will include: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Goal planning, including health needs and risk assessment (mandatory)</li>
                            <li>Communication Plan (dependent of participant requirements</li>
                            <li>Medication Plan (dependent on participant requirements)</li>
                            <li>Mealtime Management Plan (dependent on participant requirements)</li>
                            <li>Specialised module plans e.g behaviour support, SDA etc. See also Individualised Planning Policy and Procedure</li>
                            <li>Emergency Management Plan (where the participant is identified as reliant on the service for their daily needs.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Vulnerability assessment (My Safety Assessment)</b> <br>An important feature of the intake process is for a vulnerability assessment to be undertaken. The outcome of this assessment is recorded within the Master Register and determines the frequency of management oversight required in the provision of supports to ensure participant safety and quality of care.  This process is informed by the Prevention of Violence, Abuse, Neglect, Exploitation and Discrimination, as well as Emergency Management Planning (See also Prevention of Violence, Abuse, Neglect, Exploitation and Discrimination Policy and Procedure and Emergency Management Policy and Procedure.  The My Safety Assessment, additionally outlines individual risks and mitigation strategies for the participant.</p>

                    <p><b>Environmental safety checklist </b></p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Where supports are provided in the home </p>
                    <p>Where supports are provided in the participants home, an environmental safety checklist will be undertaken in consultation with the participant. The checklist allows Decent Care to identify any risks to the participant or team member in the provision of supports. 
                    Where there are identified risks, risk management strategies will be developed and the appropriate alerting mechanism will be implemented for the team member (See also Work, Health and Safety Policy and Procedure).
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Where supports are provided in settings other than the home </p>
                    <p>Where support is being provided in alternative setting, a risk assessment will be undertaken in consultation with the participant. Where risks are identified, the appropriate management strategies will be developed and recorded within the participants progress notes</p>


                    <p><b>Exiting the Service </b></p>
                    <p>A person may leave Decent Care for a number of reasons or circumstances including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>They no longer wish to access the services provided by Decent Care</li>
                            <li>A person has met all of the planned goals</li>
                            <li>Relocation to an area outside Decent Care‚Äôs area of service delivery</li>
                            <li>Where the service is no longer able to meet the person‚Äôs needs or assist in achieving chosen goals</li>
                            <li>The person is unwilling to meet the reasonable conditions required in their service agreement and thus affecting the safe delivery of a service to the participant and the health and safety of team members</li>
                            <li>Changes in the person‚Äôs condition results in the support they require exceeds the skills and expertise Decent Care can deliver</li>
                            <li>There has been no contact between the person and Decent Care for a period of three (3) months.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Service Transition</b></p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Transition</p>
                    <p>Where a person is transitioning or transferring from another service provider, Decent Care will seek permission from the person and/or their family/carer to contact their ingoing/outgoing provider to obtain information about support requirements to assist support delivery during the transition. 
                    This process includes the development of a documented plan to support the transition across services. 
                    The process includes undertaking a documented risk assessment and management plan to minimise any negative impact arising from the change. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Temporary transitions</p>
                    <p>Where a participant undertakes a temporary transition, including to a health care setting or hospitalisation, Decent Care ensures transition planning occurs to support the participant with the process. This includes undertaking a comprehensive risk assessment that is reviewed and communicated throughout the temporary period, to ensure strategies that are developed minimise any negative impacts arising from the arrangement.</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Where it is not the person‚Äôs choice to exit the service</p>
                    <p>Information regarding the reasons for being asked to leave the service will be provided and explained to the participant. These reasons will be included in the transition plan if required. 
                    The service transition will only be actioned after discussion and consultation with the participant, their family/carer and other important stakeholders, and strategies have been implemented to meet irreconcilable differences.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Exit interview</p>
                    <p>As part of the transition strategy the participant and their family or carer will be offered the opportunity to participate in an exit interview. Communication methods appropriate for the participant and supporters will be used to assist this process as required. This information will inform the continuous improvement and feedback processes to refine services and identify any training requirements for the service.</p>


                    <p><b>Training</b><br>All Decent Care team members receive training in relation to intake and transition procedures at induction and through ongoing practice review.</p>

                        </ul></p>

                        <p>Team members must apply normal hazard and risk management techniques in their day-to-day work and whenever driving any vehicle.  Certain driving environments will present a greater hazard than others. </p>

                        <p>The following instructions must be adhered to:  
                            <ul>

                                <li>Where possible, ensure participants being transported are not seated behind the driver and are secured appropriately</li>
                                <li>Follow all applicable road rules at all times</li>
                                <li>Take regular breaks from continuous driving as required, and at least every two hours</li>
                                <li>Avoid driving vehicles in off-road environments</li>
                                <li>Team member must report any vehicle accidents immediately to their Program Manager</li>
                                <li>Report immobilisation events including breakdown and bogging as an incident in accordance with Decent Care‚Äô Incident Management Policy and Procedure to enable better information to be gathered regarding the suitability of vehicles and the training provided to team members.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>


                        <p><b>Vehicle safety checks</b> <br>Decent Care will ensure the manufacturer's specified service schedule is being adhered to and any identified vehicle faults or wear and tear items are repaired. The vehicle must not be used if there is a mechanical concern, or where the pre-safety check identifies an issue with the vehicle's safety. The Managing Directors will arrange for repair of the vehicle before it is returned to service. <br>When undertaking vehicle pre-use safety checks, team members will, at a minimum:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inspect all external lights (grime can reduce their effectiveness by up to 40%)</li>
                            <li>Inspect wiper blades to ensure they clear the windscreen effectively</li>
                            <li>Clean the windscreen and rear window to ensure good visibility</li>
                            <li>Periodically check all fluid levels - engine oil, windscreen washer fluid and the radiator coolant</li>
                            <li>Check tyre pressure and condition; and</li>
                            <li>Ensure mirrors are present and oriented correctly for use.</li>
                        </ul></p>

                        <p><b>Seat belts</b> <br>By law, all occupants of a vehicle must wear seatbelts at all times. If a seat belt is starting to show signs of wear and tear, (frayed, not retracting back) the vehicle needs to be seen by an authorised repairer. For Decent Care-owned vehicles (where applicable), team members should refer the matter to their Program Manager. If transporting participants who cannot wear a seat belt, the participant must have a doctor‚Äôs certificate and team member must carry this approval with them when transporting those participants.</p>

                        <p><b>Mobile phones</b> <br>Team members must not use a hand-held mobile telephone whilst driving. Team members must pull over and stop the vehicle‚Äôs engine before answering or making phone calls or reading or responding to texts.</p>


                        <p><b>Speed</b><br>Team members must drive at a speed that suits the road conditions, vehicle, weather conditions and their driving experience.  Team members must not exceed the applicable speed limit for the road used. In the event a team member is issued with an infringement notice while driving a company owned vehicle, the team member will be nominated as the responsible driver and will be accountable for payment of the infringement and any demerit points.</p>


                        <p><b>Participant transport</b><br>Team members should undertake a risk assessment to determine if a participant can be transported alone in a vehicle.  Generally, participants with behaviours of concern should not be seated behind the driver and must wear a seat belt.  Team members must consider how best to transfer mobility restricted participants or handling wheelchairs or equipment, using good manual handling techniques to prevent an injury.</p>

                        <h2>Reporting</h2>
                        <p>In the event that a vehicle incident occurs, incident reporting procedures must be followed as per the Incident Management Policy (for participant injury/harm) and Work, Health and Safety Policy (for team member injury/harm).
                        If the incident involves a collision/damage to other vehicles or property, then additional details of the other parties involved must also be taken, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	Full Names</li>

                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>Depending on the nature of the incident and outcomes of the investigation, a review of the risk assessment and strategies for preventing an incident will be conducted before resuming any further services using vehicles.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The participant's money, or other property, is only used with the consent of the participant and for the purposed intended by the participant. Team members must not give financial advice or information.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>
                    <p><b>Home visits</b><br>Team members must only use and touch the participant's property to deliver a service for example, the use of equipment in completion of tasks. </p>



                    <p><b>Supported Independent Living/ Respite Customers</b><br>Where participants reside within a Supported Independent Living or respite setting and require assistance to manage their personal spending, Decent Care will hold individual participant labelled pencil cases with transaction records to record money received and  participant expenditure. All receipts will be held in the pencil case and reconciled weekly or at the end of the respite period whichever is sooner</p>

                    <p><b>Financial management guidelines</b><br>At times, participants may require assistance with their finances, e.g., paying bills, banking or shopping. Team members must follow guidelines and procedures outlined below when financially assisting a participant:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Team members are at <strong>no time</strong> allowed access to a participant‚Äôs personal identification number (PIN) unless written permission is provided by the participant. </li>
                            <li>Transaction receipts must be obtained and provided to the participant for the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Money Received </li>

                                    <li>Money Returned</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The team member must be sure to count the money in front of the participant on receipt and return</li>
                            <li>Team members must record all financial transactions carried out for a participant in the Financial Transaction Record and recorded in the participant‚Äôs progress notes. Records must be documented clearly, accurately and immediately</li>
                            <li>Team members must not give financial advice to participants or their companions, or act as a witness for any legal documents</li>
                            <li>Team members must not accept money or gifts from participants.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>


                    <p><b>Suspected financial abuse</b><br>Where team members suspect financial abuse when working with participants, they discuss preventative measures with participants, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Informing the participant not to relinquish control of their finances, if the participant can self-manage</li>
                        <li>Advising the participant not to make significant financial decisions following a major event, e.g. Loss of a partner</li>
                        <li>Ensuring that the participant is aware of their right to refuse people access to their funds or personal money</li>
                        <li>Encouraging the participant to ask for help if they are overwhelmed, confused, or feel they are being taken advantage of</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>


                    <p>If any team member suspects that a participant is being financially abused, then the following steps are to be taken: 

                        <ol>
                            <li>The team member is to gather evidence and record in participant's notes</li>
                            <li>The team member is to contact their Program Manager to discuss evidence gathered</li>
                            <li>The Program Manager will gather the details of the abuse and report to the Managing Directors.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>The Managing Directors will  make a report to relevant authorities for example the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission through Incident Reporting.</p>

                            <li>The Program Manager will gather the details of the abuse and report to the Managing Directors.</li>
                            <li> The Managing Directors will  make a report to relevant authorities for example the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission through Incident Reporting.</li>

                    <p>Decent Care participants may be required to take medications during the provision of support. Many participants will manage and take their medications independently, while others may ask for some form of support or assistance. This policy and procedure provide guidance and direction for team members and Support Services Program Manager in the administration of participants‚Äô medication. At no point will medication be administered without the essential training of the person supporting the medication management process. </p>

                    <h2>Policy</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care ensures that where a participant requires assistance with their medication, the nature of the assistance will be recorded in detail and the participant's consent confirmed. The medication will be managed and administered in line with the six (6) rights of medication and the processes outlined in this policy.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>
                    <p>Where a participant has identified within the intake and assessment process that they would like support with Medication Management, Decent Care will seek information from the participant that has been provided by the prescribing practitioner. This information must be no more than three (3) months old.
                    Decent Care (with the participant, carer or advocate's consent) will liaise with the family or support network, general practitioner, pharmacist, registered nurse, or an enrolled nurse to clarify aspects of the medication management, if it is unclear.  The following principles are to be followed when administering all medication including topical medications, inhaled medications, and eye drops:
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Safety considerations:</b>

                            <li>Check allergy information listed on the medication chart against medication.</li>
                            <li>Plan medication administration to avoid disruption:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dispense medication in a quiet area.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid conversation with others.</li>
                                    <li>Prepare medications for ONE participant at a time.</li>
                                </ul>

                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Step 1- </b><br>Check the medication administration chart is consistent with instructions on the medication label or doctors‚Äô orders. Where the medication chart is not consistent contact the Support Services Program Manager who will contact the prescriber.  Team members must ensure they perform hand hygiene before administrating medication and wear appropriate PPE when administering topical medication.</p>

                    <p><b>PRN Medication/Chemical Restraint (Behaviour Support Plans)</b><br>Team members are to consult with the Support Services Program Manager before administering PRN Medications. Where a participant has a behaviour support plan in place PRN medications are only to be administered in line with the plan as a last resort after consulting the Support Services Program Manager.</p>

                    <p><b>Safety</b><br>Participants are to be observed for any changes to their health status and, if noted, reported straight to the Support Services Program Manager who seeks the advice of a professional. 
                    Where a participant refuses the administration of medication, the Support Services Program Manager is to be advised. Relevant health professionals, i.e., doctor, registered or enrolled nurse, will be consulted where necessary.
                    Team members will not decide to withhold a participant‚Äôs medication unless certain about the participant‚Äôs health status. Team members must consult with a Support Services Program Manager before withholding medication and follow the Support Services Program Manager decision, in consultation with relevant health professionals, e.g., doctor, RN or EN. 
                    Where a participant is required to carry emergency medication for outings, the support worker must place the medication in a locked case. If a support worker does not remember the medication, it could result in disciplinary action.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Documentation</b><br>At the initial intake of a participant two documents must be completed including: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	A Medication Administration Consent form that includes the participant‚Äôs consent to be assisted and for the administrator to contact the dispenser if there are adverse reactions </li>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	Medication Schedule and Administration Chart which contains all details about the medication administration requirements. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>The medication administration chart will be held in a medication folder located in the respite accommodation office and a copy held on the participant‚Äôs file. On completion of stay the medication administration chart is to be scanned through to the participant‚Äôs file. 
                    Team members are to record each participant‚Äôs administration on the participant medication chart. This includes the date and time of medication administration along with their signature and printed name. 
                    Team members must record any changes to medication or health issues in the participant‚Äôs file notes and follow up with the Support Services Program Manager who will contact the relevant person, carer or pharmacist for any additional information that may be required. 
                    Any medication errors are to be recorded on an Incident Report Form. This will be recorded on the Incident Register and be reviewed by the Managing Directors for continuous improvement processes. 
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Adverse drug reactions </b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adverse drug reactions must be actioned immediately in line with Incident Management Procedures </li>
                            <li>This must then be reported immediately to the Support Services Program Manager</li>
                            <li>The Support Services Program Manager will inform the general practitioner/nurse immediately and document actions taken in the participant's health record</li>
                            <li>An adverse drug reaction is an incident and must be recorded on an Incident Form and in the participant‚Äôs health record, including symptoms and actions taken. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Medication disposal</b><br>All unused medication is to be disposed of by returning to a pharmacy who undertakes an incineration process to prevent medication from cycling back into the water supply. </p>

                    <p><b>Team members training for medication assistance  </b><br>Team members involved in assisting or supporting participants with their medication are trained in the steps to take in the event of an incident involving medication and understand the side-effects of medication. Decent Care will ensure that all team members hold current first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) qualifications, so they can correctly respond when monitoring any adverse reactions that require action, intervention, and escalation. 
                    Team members have relevant skills and experience, and a level of competency, to provide appropriate and safe support to a person with a disability. 
                    Decent Care‚Äôs team members participate in regular supervision by the Support Services Program Manager to affirm their knowledge and practice. The Service Manager will monitor expiry dates of training. Details will be recorded in team members files, where appropriate

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care management and team members ensure that all meals that are prepared for participants in line with the framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (World Health Organisation), that is incorporated into mealtime management practices.  
                    Decent Care recognise that people with disabilities frequently have associated disorders that interfere with nutrition in terms of intake, digestion or absorption of nutrients. They often require assistance from others for nutritional planning, and some are dependent on others for eating and drinking. 
                    </p>
                </div>


                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Scope </h2>
                    <p>This policy applies to team members and any person representing Decent Care who are providing meals or supporting participants with meal preparation. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Principles</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care is committed to ensuring they meet the NDIS Legislation Amendment Quality Indicators by ensuring that each participant requiring mealtime management receives meals that are nutritious, and of a texture that is appropriate to their individual needs, appropriately planned, and prepared in an environment and manner that meets their individual needs and preferences. Meals are delivered in a way that is appropriate to their individual needs and ensures meals are enjoyable. This is achieved through:

                        <ul>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	identifying each participant that requires mealtime management.</li>
                            <li>‚Ä¢	Ensuring each participant requiring mealtime management has their individual mealtime management needs assessed by appropriately qualified health practitioners, including by practitioners:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>undertaking comprehensive assessments of their nutrition and swallowing; and</li>
                                    <li>assessing their seating and positioning requirements for eating and drinking; and</li>
                                    <li>providing mealtime management plans which outline their mealtime management needs, including for swallowing, eating and drinking; and</li>
                                    <li>reviewing assessments and plans annually or in accordance with the professional advice of the participant‚Äôs practitioner, or more frequently if needs change or difficulty is observed.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>With their consent, each participant requiring mealtime management is involved in the assessment and development of their mealtime management plans. Each team member responsible for providing mealtime management to participants understands the mealtime management needs of those participants and the steps to take if safety incidents occur during meals, such as coughing or choking on food or fluids.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>

                    <p>Where it is identified that a participant may be experiencing difficulty or have specific nutritional requirements, Decent Care will seek a mealtime management plan. The assessment and planning will be conducted by an appropriately qualified practitioner and in partnership with the participant where consent is provided. Assessment and planning will include the following factors: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Participant preferences including their likes and dislikes</li>
                            <li>Specific nutritional requirements</li>
                            <li>Positioning needs</li>
                            <li>Food/fluid consistencies</li>
                            <li>Equipment needs</li>
                            <li>Communication needs</li>
                            <li>Environmental needs </li>
                            <li>Social connectedness opportunities</li>
                            <li>Considerations when eating out</li>
                            <li>Risks and management strategies</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Mealtime Management is included in participants files, which is easily accessible by all team members who administer the plan. </p>

                    <p><b>Team member Training in relation to individual participant mealtime plans:</b><br>Team members who provide mealtime management to participants are provided with information and understand the mealtime management needs of the individual participant. Team members will also understand the specific steps to take if safety incidents occur during meals, such as coughing or choking on food or fluids. This information will also be documented in the mealtime risk management plan. 
                    Where a participant has a mealtime plan, information regarding the requirements will be accessible to all team members who are administering the plan for easy reference at all times. 
                     </p>

                     <p><b>Preparation of texture modified foods:</b><br>
                        Team members who are required to provide texture modified foods will ensure the appropriate equipment, including a temperature probe are available to them when undertaking this role. Texture modified meals are provided for participants that have difficulty chewing and swallowing. Texture modified foods may be thickened, minced or pureed. Due to the extra handling involved with the preparation of texture modified foods, there is an increased potential for cross contamination and cases of foodborne illness have been attributed to hygiene failure during this process.  The following steps must be adhered to:</p>

                        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Cleaning and sanitising equipment</p>
                        <p>The equipment used will include a procedure or set of work instructions that outline the dismantling, cleaning and sanitising of equipment. Equipment used to homogenise food usually requires complete disassembly to fully clean. Contamination of blenders and mixers has been identified as a potential problem because they are difficult to clean.</p>

                        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Procedure for preparing texture modified foods </p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>

                    <p>Decent Care have a responsibility to protect participants, and any other person in the home of a participant, from harm by avoiding exposure to waste, infectious and hazardous substances generated during the delivery of supports. Decent Care‚Äôs policies, procedures and practices are in place for the safe and appropriate storage and disposal of waste and infectious or hazardous substances and the organisations policies and procedure documents (for more information see the Workl Health and Safety Policy).
                        Any incidents of exposure to waste, infectious or hazardous substances are to be referred to the Managing Directors of Operations to implement relevant processes applying to team members and participants.

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>
                    <p><b>Disposal of waste</b><br>When handling waste appropriate Personal Protective Equipment should be used (for more information see the Infection Control Policy). <br>
                        General waste can be disposed of via usual general waste means. Disposal of Clinical waste requires specific handling as per E Environment Protection Amendment Act 2018. Clinical waste will be double bagged into clearly labelled yellow waste bags and will be collected for disposal by appropriately licenced company for the disposal of medical waste (clinical waste must be incinerated). Bulk fluids such as urine and vomit can be emptied into domestic sewage systems.           <br>
                        Clinical waste awaiting disposal from the site will be stored in a designated area that is not accessible to the public. Sharps containers will be securely locked and placed out of reach of young children. Hazardous waste items should have Material Safety Data sheets available for the appropriate management and disposal for these products.
                        </p>

                    <p><b>Disposal of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</b> <br> Single-use PPE worn during regular daily support activities, such as exercise or buying groceries, should be placed in a general waste bin. For households with a suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 case, team members must place disposable PPE and tissues into a sealed plastic or paper bag, and then in the general waste bin. Team members must thoroughly clean their hands before and after carrying rubbish to the  general waste bin or moving bins to and from the kerbside. Do not place PPE in any recycling bins <br> <br>
                        <u>In home </u> <br> Put all single-use PPE items such as tissues, disposable masks, gloves in a rubbish bin that is lined with a plastic bag. <br> <br>
                        <u>Workplace (multiple team members) on site </u> <br> Put all single-use PPE items such as tissues, disposable masks, gloves in a rubbish bin that is lined with a plastic bag.
                        <ul>
                            <li>When the bin is three-quarters full, tie-off the plastic bag. This will prevent the contents in the bag from spilling. Avoid touching the inside of the bag. </li>
                            <li>Put the tied-off bag in the general waste bin. </li>
                            <li>It is good practice to put the first plastic bag in a second bag. Tie off the second bag before putting it in the general waste bin.</li>
                            <li>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, using soap and water or use a hand sanitiser that contains at least 60 per cent alcohol</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        
                        <u>PPE with blood or bodily fluids </u> <br>Dispose of PPE which has been soiled by bodily fluids or blood, in a clinical waste bin where possible. Where a clinical waste bin is unavailable place soiled PPE in a sealed plastic bag. Put the first sealed plastic bag in a second bag. Seal or tie off the second bag before putting it in a secure general waste bin.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Scope</h2>
                    <p>The policy applies to all team members, students, volunteers, and contractors who work with participants.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Principles </h2>
                    <p>Infectious agents cause disease or illness to their hosts. Infection control is the prevention of the transmission of infectious agents and managing infections if they occur. The most common forms of transmission are contact, droplet, blood borne, and air borne. 
                    Standard precautions are work practices that provide the first line approach to infection prevention, they should be adopted by all team members working with participants. Standard precautions should be applied in all settings regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status. Standard precautions are used to reduce or prevent the transmission of infectious agents and to render and maintain objects and healthcare areas as free as possible from infectious agents.
                    </p>
                </div>


                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Policy</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care will ensure infection control strategies and procedures are trained out to all team members. Decent Care will ensure that appropriate PPE will be supplied to team members and they are trained in its use. Decent Care will ensure that infection control strategies and procedures are regularly assessed and consistent with current best practice and relevant guidelines and standards. Records of infection control activities are maintained, including infection control training. Any incidents raised in relation to infection control issues will be reviewed and if necessary, actions will be implemented to ensure the incident does not reoccur, affected team members will be given the opportunity to debrief if required. Infection control risks will be identified; strategies will be developed and implemented for the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Hand hygiene</h2>
                    <p>Hand hygiene is the single most effective action to reduce health care associated infections. It is the simple action of hand cleansing and when performed correctly results in a reduction of microorganisms on hands.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Hands can be cleaned with soap and water or alcohol based handrub</li>
                            <li>Alcohol based hand rub can be used where hands are visibly clean</li>
                            <li>Wash with soap and water where hands are visibly soiled</li>
                            <li>Wash hands before eating and after going to the bathroom</li>
                            <li>Wash hands between care for participants.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>See Appendix 1 for WHO posters on how to Handrub and how to hand wash.
                        WHO recommends using the 5 moments of hand hygiene as the guide as to when hand hygiene should be performed in a care setting.
                        </p>


                    <p><b>Personal protective equipment (PPE)</b><br>All team members whom provide direct support to participants is able to access PPE from Decent Care. This is also available to participants for the duration of time of which the team member is providing support. </p>
                    <p>Personal protective equipment is equipment that provides a barrier between the team members and the participant items include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gloves</li>
                            <li>Protective eyewear</li>
                            <li>Face masks</li>
                            <li>Plastic aprons or gowns.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>PPE should be utilised where there is a possibility of sprays or spills or exposure to blood or body substances during a procedure. Examples may include wearing, wearing gloves when changing a dressing or changing a bed that has body fluids contaminating it. Gloves should be changed after every procedure and in between care occurring between participants. Gloves do not replace hand washing: hand washing should be completed after removing gloves.
                    Glasses and goggles are reusable and can be wiped down after use.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Cleaning of shared participant equipment </b><br>Any equipment that is shared by participants must be wiped down with a detergent solution between use.</p>
                    <p><b>Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette</b><br>Team members should cough or sneeze into a tissue or their elbow and always wash hands after this has occurred. Covering sneezes and coughs prevents people who are infected from dispersing droplets into the air where they can spread to others.</p>
                    <p><b>Routine environmental cleaning</b><br>All team members who support participants must ensure standard precautions are implemented throughout all settings in which support is provided to participants. 
                    When delivering support to participants, team members are required to maintain work areas in a clean condition, regularly wipe down frequently touched surfaces with disinfectant and with warm water and mild detergent. They must keep cleaning equipment in good working order and ensure floors are in a clean condition, no signs of visible dirt and mopped/ vacuumed regularly.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Safe handling and disposal of waste and used linen safely</b><br>See Management of Waste Policy for management and disposal of waste.
                    Used linen should be handled carefully, to avoid spreading infectious agents into the environment or onto team members clothing. Do not carry soiled linen, take the linen basket to the bedside. Wash with hot water and detergent.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Infectious disease outbreak management</b><br>An outbreak can be defined as: "when there are more cases of infection with the same organism than would normally be expected in one area or period of time". 
                    https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/health-advice/public-health/preventing-infection 
                    In the event of an outbreak in a shared accommodation facility, infected participants should be isolated. Relevant medical practitioners and health authorities should be notified. Further information can be found in the government publication ‚ÄúThe Blue Book‚Äù  
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Team member suspected illness and vaccination </b><br>Team Members must not present for their shift if they are known to have an infectious illness. They may return to work once they are symptom free or they have a certificate of clearance from their medical practitioner. Any team members presenting with signs and symptoms of an infectious disease may be sent home by management.
                    In the event of Gastroenteritis team members may not return to work until they have been symptom free for over 48 hours after all symptoms have resolved.
                    Participants attending day programs should remain home until well.
                    Consideration should be given to support workers that work within supported accommodation, day program setting where there is a risk of a splash or spill from body fluids to be vaccinated.
                    </p>
                    <p>Recommended vaccinations include:</p>

                        <p>This includes any change or event that: <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Significantly affects the ability to comply with conditions of registration and the NDIS Practice Standards</li>
                                <li>Seriously impairs ability to effectively conduct operations and deliver ongoing supports or services to NDIS participants </li>
                                <li>Adversely affects a person with disability to gain access to the supports or services that Decent Care are registered to deliver. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>Notification will be made to the NDIS Commission of any changes to the scale of operations by emailing registrations@ndiscommission.gov.au, calling 1800 035 544 or completing the Notification of changes or events form ‚Äì COVID19 (registered providers) on the NDIS Commission website.</p>

                        <p><b>Risk Management </b><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Decent Care will undertake a risk assessment of the supports and services that are provided. This includes the degree to which NDIS participants rely on the supports and services to meet their daily living needs, and the extent to which their health and safety would be affected, should those services be disrupted. </li>
                                <li>Understand the specific needs of each participant and how they would like to receive information. Understand how this would be impacted if changes were made to existing service and support arrangements</li>
                                <li>Ensure participant records are up-to-date and accessible, so that their support needs and preferences are clear, documented, and available should new or temporary team member be required to support them. Records might include participants preferred means of communication, specific needs and preferences, health care plans, behaviour support plans, their representatives and information of other support providers</li>
                                <li>If possible, understand any informal supports and services that may be available to the person with disability.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Communicate effectively </b><br>Decent Care will ensure all stakeholders are aware of their roles and responsibilities under the plan. This will occur through:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Familiarising team member and any third parties with the business continuity arrangements (See Business Continuity Emergency Management  Plan and Covid-19 Plan)</li>
                                <li>Familiarising team members with policies, procedures, and responsibilities regarding infection control</li>
                                <li>Make sure clear communication channels are in place with all NDIS participants that Decent Care supports. This will enable the effective communication of any changes that might be required to a participant‚Äôs supports and services. Where Government restrictions limit public gatherings and closure of certain facilities and businesses, exploration of alternatives for activities or supports that must be ceased or adjusted must be considered.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Strategies to prepare for potential organisational outbreak include: </b><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Having leave entitlements to ensure that all team members, regardless of their employment status, can access leave to allow them to self-isolate if required.</li>
                                <li>Temporary changes have been made to awards (including to the Social, Community, Home Care and Disability Services Industry Award 2010) to include a minimum entitlement of 2 weeks unpaid pandemic leave </li>
                                <li>Maintaining an up-to-date contact list of all team members, including casual or agency team members. The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) has links for platforms who match providers with new or backup support workers, streamlining the on boarding of new team members to maintain health, wellbeing, and safety, and avoid risk of harm</li>
                                <li>Ensure all team members have updated training in infection control procedures, including standard precautions (hand hygiene, correct use of appropriate PPE where needed (and disposal procedures), and cough and sneeze etiquette) and transmission-based precautions (contact and droplet precautions)</li>
                                <li>Ensure all team members have undertaken the Department of Health COVID-19 infection control training</li>
                                <li>Implement standard infection control precautions  </li>
                                <li>Establish communication channels to keep team members informed of any updates or changes to business processes as a result of the outbreak. This includes contracted or agency team member, such as cleaners</li>
                                <li>Undertake a stocktake of consumables and source additional supplies if necessary. This could include compiling an ‚Äòoutbreak kit‚Äô with items such as: 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>personal protective equipment </li>
                                        <li>hand hygiene products (hand sanitiser, liquid soap) </li>
                                        <li>cleaning supplies  </li>
                                        <li>other essential supplies such as toilet paper and food. </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Plan for increased environmental cleaning, including where additional cleaners and oversight is required </li>
                                <li>Identify any participants who have advance care or healthcare or support plans and keep a copy if possible. Additionally, prepare a hospital bag with things they might need for an overnight stay</li>
                                <li>Develop an emergency plan for participants. This should contain details of the participant‚Äôs emergency contacts (e.g. family, guardian or advocate), current GP, any medical conditions as well as ongoing treatment and current medications, including dose and frequency</li>
                                <li>Where in-home support is provided to participants, team members should: 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>consider how the service would monitor their safety and wellbeing if they could not receive services temporarily </li>
                                        <li>make a record of participants who can only be contacted by a face-to-face visit (that is, if they cannot use the phone independently) </li>
                                        <li>give the participant and their family, guardian, or advocate contact details of someone they can call if there is a change to their health condition or circumstances (such as, if they develop symptoms, are in self-isolation or have been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Criteria for when team members should not come to work or have contact with participants</b><br>All team members should take reasonable precautions to continue to provide supports and services in a safe and competent manner with care and skill and to keep themselves and others safe.
                        Team members must not go to work if they have:
                        <ul>
                            <li>a fever, or even mild symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, sore throat,</li>
                            <li>runny nose or nasal congestion, tiredness or loss of smell or taste</li>
                            <li>returned from overseas or interstate in the last 14 days</li>
                            <li>been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>If a team member experiences even mild symptoms of respiratory illness (such as those outlined above), they must report those symptoms to their Team Leader. If they experience any of these symptoms for the first time during a shift, they should leave work as soon as practicable, report their symptoms as identified above, get tested for COVID-19, and seek medical advice from their doctor or call the National Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 020 080.</p>
                        <p><b>Training</b><br>Decent Care team members will be trained in this policy and access an online training module. The training covers the fundamentals of infection prevention and control (IPC) for COVID-19.</p>

                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Decent Care has processes in place to ensure each person's human rights are respected and upheld. Where a person's behaviour requires some restriction of their rights, Decent Care ensure the least restrictive alternative is applied only as part of an interim or comprehensive behaviour support plan (BSP), and for as little time as possible. Decent Care is registered with NDIS for Module 2A- Implementation of Behaviour Support Plans per the instruction and training from a registered NDIS behaviour support practitioner. Decent Care will work with people who use the service, their support network and advocates to always aim for best practice for each person who has a restriction placed on their rights. </p>

                        <h2>Scope</h2>
                        <p>
                            This policy applies to all team members and management. The Implementing Behaviour Support Plans Policy and Procedure provides an evidence-informed, person-centred framework for Decent Care to provide safe support to individuals who demonstrate challenging behaviours.

                        <h2>Principles</h2>
                        <p>
                            Decent Care acknowledges that challenging behaviours are often the result of interaction between the person and their environment. 
Decent Care is committed to implementing person-centred, evidence-based principles in the implementation of behaviour support plans and aim to reduce and eliminate the use of restrictive practice. 

                        </p>

                    <div class="section">
                        <h2>Policy </h2> 
                        <p>Decent Care will ensure that processes and strategies are in place to monitor and review all interventions that restrict individual‚Äôs rights and report all instances rigorously in line with NDIS, and Victorian Government requirements.  Under the NDIS Commission, registered providers are required to comply with the NDIS Act, Guidelines and Rules including the NDIS (Restrictive Practices and Behaviour Support) Rules 2018. A NDIS behaviour support plan must be developed, confirmed and lodged with the NDIS Commission and authorised by the state. Behaviour support focuses on person-centred interventions to address the underlying causes of behaviours of concern or challenging behaviours while safeguarding people's dignity and quality of life who require specialist behaviour support.</p>

                        <p><b id="bsp">Behaviour Support Plans (BSP)</b><br>A NDIS Behaviour Support Plan (BSP) is a document developed for a person with a disability by a NDIS behaviour support practitioner. 
                            A BSP is developed in consultation with the individual, their family, carers, guardian, and other relevant people and the service providers who will be implementing the plan. A BSP focuses on the individual needs of the person with behaviours of concern. This includes positive behaviour support to:
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li>Build on the person's strengths.</li>
                                <li>Increase their opportunities to participate in community activities.</li>
                                <li>Increase their life skills.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Decent Care team members are responsible for implementing BSPs in collaboration with the person and their family or carer, including where restrictive practice is included in the BSP. Decent Care team members will support behaviour support practitioners to gather information and data for assessments including functional assessments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b id="pbs">Positive Behaviour Support</b> <br> Decent Care recognises that unmet needs can significantly impact an individual's ability to feel calm, regulated and connected to others. When this occurs, challenging behaviour may result as an expression of those unmet needs.

                        <p>Decent Care team members use Positive Behaviour Support strategies in their daily practice with the primary goal of empowering individuals and enhancing their quality of life by proactively preventing behaviours of concern from occurring through:

                                <li>Ensuring participant's needs are met by supporting their communication method so they can access what they require. </li>
                                <li>Understanding that all challenging behaviours have a function or a reason and work with the participant to understand what those reasons are. </li>
                                <li>Develop goal plans in collaboration with the participant, support network and team members. This ensures a consistent approach across all areas of the participant's life to reinforces positive behaviours. </li>
                                <li>Identifying factors that contribute to challenging behaviours to minimise the occurrence, where possible </li>
                                <li>Documenting and analysing where strategies are successful or unsuccessful to develop an evidence base for positive behaviour strategies.</li>

                        <p><b>Reducing and eliminating restrictive practice framework</b><br>From the outset, consideration will be given to gradually reducing (and eliminating over time) the use of the restrictive practice. The following principles are applied: <br>
                            <u>Person-centred focus</u> <br> Decent Care recognises that participants and support networks are the natural authority of their own lives and support this by encouraging participants to exercise choice and control in their support. 
                            By working with the participant to understand the nature and function of their behaviour, team members can respond appropriately with an emphasis on prevention. Prevention strategies include proactive skill building and environmental design to reduce and eliminate restrictive intervention over time.
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use of individualised and evidence-based practices such as teaching the use of replacement skills (skills the person can use to replace the challenging behaviours), based on the principles of positive behaviour support.</li>
                                <li>Participate in Care Team Meetings to review individual behaviour support plans regularly, providing evidence of strategy implementation outcomes. Reviews are undertaken in collaboration with the participants and their guardians or advocates, as active participants in decisions about their lives, support and care.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Leadership towards organisational change</u><br>Decent Care‚Äôs goal is to reduce and eliminate restrictive practice. This goal is demonstrated through an organisation commitment at all management levels. Decent Care, support their team members to develop an understanding of positive behaviour support and restrictive intervention through training opportunities in addition to individualised training.
                            Decent Care key implementation areas:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Demonstrate a commitment to the reduction and elimination of restrictive practice at all management levels through implementing a culture of positive behaviour support.</li>
                                    <li>Provide access to information, training, and coaching aimed at reducing restrictive practices.</li>
                                    <li>Analyse individual outcomes through review of Managing Directors meeting minutes and incident reports to inform policies and procedures.</li>
                                </ul>                            
                        </p>
                        <p><u>Use of data to inform practices.</u><br>Decent Care provides reporting tools to team members to record all interventions used in each support plan to facilitate reflection and consider continuous improvement opportunities.
                            Data collection is important to determine what factors are effective in reducing or eliminating the use of restrictive practices and to inform the behaviour support practitioner  in plan reviews.

                            <br>
                            Section 7 of the Disability Act 2006 (Victoria) states the requirement for a Disability Service Provider to appoint a person responsible, an APO, for the protection of the rights of any person subject to a Restrictive Intervention.  
Applications to be an APO in Victoria need to be submitted through Restrictive Intervention Data System (RIDS; see appendix A for instructions on how to  register) and must be approved by the Victorian Senior Practitioner. <br>

                    The Authorised Program Officer will:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monitor the well-being of any individual subject to approved restrictive interventions and ensure they have a Behaviour Support Plan in place </li>
                        <li>Report any incidence of the application of approved restrictive interventions to the NDIS commission</li>
                        <li>Monitor and report the occurrence of any emergency or unapproved applications of restrictive interventions</li>
                        <li>Ensure an independent person is available to explain inclusion of a restrictive practice in a NDIS behaviour support plan to a person with a disability</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <u id="arrp">Authorisation of Regulated Restrictive Practices- Victoria</u> <br>
                    The APO is required to authorise the use of all regulated restrictive practices. 
An APO may only authorise the use of a regulated restrictive practice if the proposed use is:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Necessary to prevent a person from causing physical harm to the person or another person</li>
                        <li>The option which is the least restrictive of the person as is possible in the circumstances</li>
                        <li>Included in and used in accordance with the person‚Äôs NDIS behaviour support plan</li>
                        <li>Not applied for longer than necessary, and</li>
                        <li>In accordance with the NDIS commission‚Äôs requirements (under the NDIS (Restrictive Practices and Behaviour Support) Rules 2018 (Cth).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                    <p>
                        An APO may only authorise the use of seclusion as a regulated restrictive practice if:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The above requirements are met</li>
                            <li>The person is supplied with appropriate bedding and clothing</li>
                            <li>The person has access to adequate heating and cooling (as is appropriate for the circumstances)</li>
                            <li>The person is provided with food and drink at the appropriate times, and</li>
                            <li>The person is provided with adequate toilet arrangements.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The APO may authorise the use of a regulated restrictive practice subject to any condition the APO considers appropriate, other than requiring a variation to the person‚Äôs NDIS behaviour support plan.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the APO has authorised the NDIS behaviour support plan, the plan is to be provided to the Victorian Senior Practitioner through RIDS. The Victorian Senior Practitioner may require the APO to provide additional information with the NDIS behaviour support plan including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Information about the implementation of the previous behaviour support plan</li>
                            <li>Reportable incidents (including emergency use) since the previous behaviour support plan was approved, or for the last 24 months if there was not a previous behaviour support plan</li>
                            <li>Relevant assessments</li>
                            <li>Any other information required by the Victorian Senior Practitioner.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the APO authorisation, additional approval is required from the Victorian Senior Practitioner for the use of the following regulated restrictive practices:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Physical restraint</li>
                            <li>Mechanical restraint</li>
                            <li>Seclusion</li>
                        </ul>  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Victorian Senior Practitioner may direct those additional regulated restrictive practices or the use of restrictive practices on particular cohorts requires additional authorisation.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <u id="cip">Consent and Independent Person</u> <br>
                        The use of an independent person is a requirement of Victoria‚Äôs authorisation process. 
An APO must ensure that an independent person is available to explain inclusion of a restrictive practice in a BSP to a person with a disability and that the person may seek a review of the APOs decision (and Victorian Senior Practitioner‚Äôs decision if applicable) by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT).
                        <br>
                        An Independent Person must not:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be a NDIS provider or disability service provider to the person,</li>
                            <li>Have an interest in an NDIS provider or disability service provider to the person, or</li>
                            <li>Have any responsibility in relation to the development or review of the person NDIS behaviour support plan.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consent must be sought from the participant or their formal decision maker regarding the implementation of restricitive practices.
                        The APO must provide information to the Victorian Senior Practitioner that an independent person has been made available to the person and consent sought regarding the restrictive interventions. 
                        
                    </p>

Whenever the use of a restrictive practice, whether authorised or not, results in serious injury to a person, this is a reportable incident requiring notification to the NDIS Commission within 24 hours.

                        Decent Care undertake regular review of restrictive practice processes for each individual in order to identify areas for practice and systemic improvement. Following an unanticipated or emergency use of restrictive intervention an immediate post event de-briefing must be completed on site led by a senior staff member on duty. 
                        The goal of this immediate de-briefing is to ensure that everyone is safe, that satisfactory information is available to inform the later structured de-briefing process and that the person subject to the restraint is safe and being appropriately monitored. 
                        Formal de-briefing will occur as soon as practicable after the event and will include all involved, the treatment team and relevant administrative team members. The participant and their guardian or advocates will be involved in de-briefing and review processes to ensure their perspectives and experiences are understood.

                            <b id="isp">Interim Support Plans </b> <br> Where a regulated restrictive practice has been implemented without a behaviour support plan in place, Decent Care will take all reasonable steps to facilitate the development of an interim behaviour support by a NDIS behaviour support practitioner  that covers the use of the practice within one (1) month after the first use of the regulated restrictive practice. Decent Care is aware that the behaviour support practitioner  is required to develop the Interim Behaviour Support plan within one (1) of being engaged.
                            The Interim Plan is required to be replaced by a Comprehensive Behaviour Support Plan within 6 months of the NDIS behaviour support practitioner  being engaged to develop the plan as per the National Disability Insurance Scheme (Restrictive Practices and Behaviour Support) Rules 2018. 
                            Decent Care will work collaboratively with behaviour support practitioner  and other implementing providers to ensure they are aware of and implementing approved strategies including any restrictive interventions.

                            <b id="mrbsp">Monitoring and Review Behaviour Support Plans</b> <br> Decent Care uses the behaviour response analysis tool (BRAT) to record and allow analysis of all behavioural intervention strategies and reviews the data collected regularly to identify actions for improving outcomes for both comprehensive and interim BSPs. Decent Care will monitor the implementation of each participant's BSP  through review of data, record keeping, team members meetings, supervision, team members and participant feedback. Behaviour Support Plans will be reviewed at planned intervals, at least yearly or sooner if there are changes to the regulated restrictive practices used  or intended to be used including where restrictive practices are to be reduced or eliminated. Plans will be reviewed with the participant, the behaviour support practitioner  and any person the participant chooses to ensure strategies are effective and continue to reflect the least restrictive supports.

The below steps are outlined by the Department of Health and Human Services to register for an eBusiness account to grant providers access to RIDS:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Contact the eBusiness Administrator on 1300 799 470. At the prompt, request to speak to the eBusiness Administrator.</li>
                            <li>The eBusiness Administrator will check to see whether your organisation is already registered in eBusiness, and whether you have an existing eBusiness account with that organisation.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If your organisation is registered and you have an existing eBusiness account, the eBusiness Administrator will advise you to log-in to your account and follow the prompts in the ‚ÄòMy Requests‚Äô tab to request access to RIDS. </li>
                                    <li>If your organisation is registered but you do not have an existing eBusiness account, you will be advised to register online.
                                        You can register online by going to http://www.dhs.vic.gov.au/home, then under ‚ÄòPopular links‚Äô selecting ‚ÄòeBusiness login‚Äô. Click on ‚ÄòI want to register‚Äô and follow the process.
                                        </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>If your organisation is not registered, the eBusiness Administrator will email you the 'eBusiness Access Agreement' and 'Organisational Authority (OA) nomination form'. Alternatively, these will be emailed directly to the organisation Chief Executive Officer or equivalent office bearer if their details are available. </li>
                            <li>The Chief Executive Officer or equivalent needs to print and sign the Access Agreement and Organisation Authority and return to the department.</li>
                            <li>Once approved by the Department of Health and Human Services, the eBusiness Administrator will create the organisation in eBusiness. </li>
                            <li>The eBusiness Administrator will advise the nominated Organisation Authority to set-up access to the Enterprise User Service. The Enterprise User Service is used to grant team members in the organisation access to RIDS.</li>
                            <li>When an organisation initially requests access to RIDS, the request will be referred to a delegate within the department for approval.</li>
                            <li>You can then seek approval to access RIDS through online (see step 2). </li>

                    <h2></h2>
                    <p>Each resident will be supported to understand the terms and conditions that apply to their dwelling and the associated service and/or residency agreements.  Additionally, participants of Decent Care will be provided with a welcome pack that includes information relating to their rights. All forms related to participant‚Äôs residency will be provided in easy read format if required. This information will be explained in a language, terms and mode that the participant is most likely to understand. <br>
                        As a provider of Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) Decent Care demonstrate meaningful separation of the functions when delivering two or more types of support including Supported Independent Living (SIL) in the same residence.
Where Decent Care delivers tenancy management and another type of support to a participant this will be managed through an Appendix A to the service agreement, that outlines the functions of the two areas of service.
                        <br>
                        Decent Care ensures that each resident is provided with an agreement that meets the requirements of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (Specialist Disability Accommodation Conditions) Rules 2020, Disability Services Act (2006) and Residential Tenancies Act 1997.
                        <br>
                        Where possible, participants are required to sign their residency agreement. Where not possible, it will be signed by the plan nominee or advocate and documented reasons for why the participant has not signed.  
                        <br>
                        All residents will receive a copy of their signed agreement prior to moving in. Residency agreements are developed in collaboration with participants and their representatives. 
                        <br>
                        All properties will be registered with National Disability Insurance Scheme and will meet the required Specialist Disability Accommodation Rules 2018 and Liveable Housing Guidelines Edition 4. 
                        <br>
                        Properties will meet the design type, category and density restrictions as specified in the documents. All properties will be maintained and in a good state of repair, having regard to the safety, security and privacy of residents. An annual testament will be provided to NDIS to confirm that properties are in good state of repair and continue to meet the standards of which they were initially registered against.
                        <br>
                        Decent Care will ensure there are no restrictions placed on any service provider that is required to provide support to any of the residents.
Decent Care will ensure that the number of residents at a residence does not exceed the number of residents for which it is enrolled.
                        <br>
                        Where the property is a shared living arrangement, each resident will have a private bedroom at the SDA dwelling that:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Satisfies the minimum design requirements for an SDA design category specified in the participant‚Äôs plan</li>
                            <li>Is occupied by only the eligible participant, unless the eligible participant freely chooses to reside in the bedroom with one or more persons. Where this is the case, the resident must provide this agreement in writing. NDIS must be satisfied that the arrangement does not adversely affect the person.  NDIS will be notified of the request prior to accepting the arrangement. </li>
                            <li>The bathroom must meet the minimum standards that is approved in the participant‚Äôs plan.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>All agreements run for the period stated in the agreement. However, the agreement is automatically extended for the same period unless the participant or Decent Care terminate it in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act 1997. The Residency agreement will keep being extended automatically for the same period until the agreement is terminated.</p>

                    <h2>Procedure</h2>
                    <p>Decent Care will utilise the service provider networks to advertise vacancies as they arise. This will be via social media, SDA Vacancy platforms and local media.
                        Applications will be assessed on the basis of the existing environmental factors by Managing Directors, Tenancy manager/s and support workers involved in the existing dynamic. This will be documented through an allocation decision form.
                        All participants will be provided with information in the form of a welcome pack, during the initial agreement signing. 
                        <br>
                        The resident welcome pack includes:

                            <b>Residency agreement</b> <br>
                            A Residency Agreement is a requirement of the Disability Services Act. It sets out the residential services (including costs, responsibilities etc) provided in the residence. The Residency Agreement is provided to all residents and a copy sent to administrator‚Äôs annually by the service provider. An easy read version is available for all residents.
                            <br>
                            An SDA residency agreement will be provided to residents in Easy English as possible.  All residents of a single SDA dwelling are required to be on the same type of agreement to ensure consistent rules. The Residency Agreement may be reviewed and or amended annually. Residency agreements will be in line with Residential Tenancies Act 1997. 
The initial sign-up process includes information about the dwelling safety features, including fire alarms and building evacuation procedures, and how support providers will be informed. Each dwelling will have posters that outline the procedure posted.
Reasonable rent contribution, as outlined in the NDIS Rules, will be identified in the Residency Agreement. Any rental cost increases will be communicated to the resident with 60 days‚Äô notice. 
 A collaboration agreement (MOU) will be signed between Decent Care and other providers prior to the commencement of any new SIL services. The MOU may be reviewed and or amended annually.   
Participants may agree to receive notices electronically if they wish, however they must update their email address immediately when changes have been made to the address.
Where another service has been engaged to provide Supported Independent Living (SIL), a memorandum of understanding will be created that outlines the communication process between them and Decent Care. 
This will be created upon negotiation and agreement with Decent Care. This will ensure that all parties work together to ensure smooth service delivery. 
If damages occur that are not in the course of fair wear and tear, accidental damage, reasonable use of any aides or equipment, or any behaviour arising from the disability a notice will be issued.

                        <p><b>Adjustments to meet participants‚Äô needs</b><br>Where reasonable adjustments are required to make the property safer and increases participant mobility, the participant or support provider should put the request in writing to the Tenancy Manager who will seek approval from the Decent Care Managing Directors.
                            Where a change in participants‚Äô needs or circumstances occurs and the needs exceed the design category or functionality of the dwelling, work is undertaken to modify the dwelling, following consideration of the modifications on other residents. Where this cannot be accommodated, the participant and support network are made aware of the need to find alternative accommodation.
                            <br>

                            If Decent Care is required to provide notice to enter the dwelling or the room, Decent Care will send the notice by email, by post or handing it to the participant personally. 
                            The notice must state why the Decent Care (and anyone Decent Care needs to bring along) needs to enter. If there are other residents in the dwelling, each resident must receive the notice.
                            If Decent Care is showing the dwelling to another person who wishes to become a resident, Decent Care can hold up to two, one-hour long inspections a week (unless otherwise agreed with residents) and can only do so in the last 21 days before the participant move out. 
                            If Decent Care is showing the dwelling to another person who wishes to purchase the dwelling or use the dwelling as security for a loan, they can conduct up to two, one-hour long inspections a week (unless otherwise agreed with residents). Decent Care will notify participants of the proposed sale at least 14 days in advance and make reasonable efforts to negotiate the inspection times with the residents. Participants are entitled to compensation of half a days‚Äô rent for each inspection.
                            When Decent Care wishes to conduct a general inspection, the participant must have resided there for at least three months before Decent Care can conduct the general inspection. 
                            Participants can only be asked to pay 30 days‚Äô rent in advance.  An agreement can be made between Decent Care and the participant to pay the rent weekly, fortnightly or monthly in the Agreement.

                            <b>Rental contribution</b><br>
                            The National Disability Insurance Scheme (Specialist Disability Accommodation) Rules 2016 (‚ÄòSDA Rules 2020‚Äô), made under the NDIS Act, together with the terms of business, provide for the ‚Äòreasonable rent contribution‚Äô (RRC) that registered SDA providers can receive from NDIS participants. <br>If the participant receives the Disability Support Pension, RRC must not exceed:
                            <ul>
                                <li>25 per cent of basic rate of the Disability Support Pension</li>
                                <li>plus 100 per cent of any Commonwealth Rent Assistance received. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the participant does not receive the Disability Support Pension, the participants RRC must not exceed the above.
                            In exceptional circumstances participants may make a contribution over the RRC, in accordance with the SDA Rules 2020, rules 7.30 and 7.31. They can pay rent by a bank transfer method and have the option of paying rent by Centrepay. 
                            Decent Care will give participants information about any costs and fees the participant may incur by using a particular method of paying rent before gaining consent to using that payment method. 
                            Decent Care will provide a receipt where requested by the participant, and if cash is provided a receipt must be issued on the spot.
                            Decent Care will only increase the rent at minimum of every six months if required.
                            Decent Care will give participants written notice that the rent will increase at least 60 days before the increased rent is due. 
                            Decent Care will never take any of the participant goods as payment of rent.
                            If participants receive a notice that rent is going to increase, and they believe the increase is excessive, they can complain to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (Residential Tenancies List) (VCAT) in 30 days after receiving the notice. VCAT and the (Residents Victoria) Advocacy Service will investigate the matter and provide a report to the participant, their guardian or administrator and Decent Care.  
                            VCAT may decline to prepare a report if the issue is frivolous or vexatious and does not justify making a report. 
                            After the participant receives the report, they can apply to VCAT for an order that the rent is excessive, but it must be within 30 days of receiving the report. The participant can apply directly to VCAT without first complaining to Residents Victoria, but they must apply within 30 days of receiving the notice of the rent increase.
                            The participant must pay either the increased rent, or the old rent plus 10 per cent, whichever is the lesser amount, whilst waiting for VCAT to state their position.

                            <b>Other charges</b> <br>Participants are not required to pay a bond or any other amount in addition to the rent other than the amount for ordinary usage of gas, electricity, water and utilities.
                            Decent Care is liable for the following utility costs and charges:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Initial connection of electricity, water, gas, bottled gas or oil supply service to the dwelling</li>

                            </ul>                            
                        </p>
                        <p>If there is excessive usage of a service caused by a fault in the building or structure of the dwelling or any fixtures connected to the dwelling (for example, usage charges caused by a leak in an underground pipe of a water service), Decent Care is liable for that part of the charge that is additional to ordinary usage.</p>

                            <b>Duties of Decent Care</b><br>
                            Decent Care has a number of specific duties in relation to the participant and their dwelling. 
Decent Care will:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Maintain dwellings and ensure they are in a good state of repair.</li>
                                    <li>Take reasonable steps to ensure that participants are treated with dignity and respect, and to ensure that the participant‚Äôs privacy is protected. Decent Care must not unreasonably interfere with the participants right to privacy.</li>
                                    <li>Install requirements that the participant needs to help them with daily life, use and enjoyment of the dwelling, and ensure that the dwelling and installations are maintained in good repair. </li>
                                    <li>Take reasonable steps to ensure that repairs and any renovations are attended to promptly and are carried out by a suitably qualified person. Decent Care also minimise any inconvenience or disruption to the participant because of the repairs or renovations.</li>
                                    <li>Take reasonable measures to ensure that the participants dwelling is secure.</li>
                                    <li>Not unreasonably refuse to give consent to the participant to request to keep a pet at the dwelling. They may reasonably refuse to give consent to the participants request if:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Another resident living in the same dwelling has not consented to the keeping of the pet and has reasonable grounds for not consenting, or</li>
                                            <li>The pet would create a health and safety hazard if kept at the dwelling. </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If Decent Care does not carry out these duties, the participant can give them a Breach of duty notice. The Breach of duty notice must set out the breach and require it to be fixed or seek money as compensation. If Decent Care does not fix the problem or pay the participant the compensation, the participant can apply to VCAT for an order for the problem to be fixed or money paid.
In addition, SDA Rule 2020, made under the NDIS Act, requires that registered SDA providers must ensure that SDA enrolled dwellings are in a good state of repair and are being appropriately maintained, having regard to the safety, security and privacy of the residents. Decent Care will provide an annual declaration to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (NDIS Commission) that they meet this condition of registration.  This will be undertaken by Managing Directors.

If Decent Care, mortgagee or owner of the dwelling has applied to VCAT for a possession order because the participant has not paid rent, the VCAT can reject the application if the participant pays the rent that is owing, but if the participant does not pay the rent owing, a possession order can be made.
VCAT cannot make a possession order if the reason for the Notice to vacate was that the participant did not comply with one of its orders, but it is satisfied that this is the first time that the participant have not complied with the order and that the participant have since complied with or tried to comply with the order as much as the participant can.
If VCAT makes a possession order, a warrant of possession can be issued immediately, or VCAT can order that the participant be given a notice to appear at VCAT after seven days to explain why a warrant of possession should not be issued.
If a warrant of possession is issued, a police officer or other authorised person can enter the participants dwelling and make the participant move out. The participant can only be made to move out between 8am and 6pm on Monday to Saturday, and not on a Sunday or a public holiday.
The participant‚Äôs goods cannot be removed under the warrant.
