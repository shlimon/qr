      <h2>Individual Planning Policy and Procedure</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="policy">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Decent Care is committed to pursuing the rights and principles of equality, independence, choice and inclusion that underpin a person-centred philosophy. The individual planning process is a person centred and inclusive approach to support participants to develop and maintain their skills and capacity and to have a lifestyle based on their interests and aspirations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>This policy applies to all Management and team members who are involved in the planning of participant supports. </p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <h2>Principles</h2>
        <p>Goal Planning is an important component of Decent Care support process to ensure that each participant can achieve success in their chosen activities. The “About Me and My Supports” is a holistic and collaborative process that explores participants aspirations and defines their chosen activities. Goal plans are developed based on the information sourced from the About Me and My Supports Form, whilst identifying individual participant risk. Goal plans are reviewed on a regular basis to monitor outcomes as well as review and manage any risks.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <h2>Policy</h2>
        <p>Individual planning and review processes aim to support people to move toward a more positive lifestyle through enhancing decision-making opportunities and facilitating social integration, participation, and inclusion in the community. The planning process also provides information to maintain safety and continuity of support in the event of natural disaster.</p>
        <p>The “About Me and My Supports” provides information about all plans associated with the care of the participant as well as a guide to supporting participant needs and personal preferences. This includes where relevant: 
            <ul>
                <li>My Safety Plan (formerly the risk and vulnerability assessment)</li>
                <li>My Goal Plan that includes personal goals and health-related goals (including goal activity risk assessment)</li>
                <li>Mealtime Management Plan</li>
                <li>Behaviour Support Plan</li>
                <li>SDA Agreement</li>
                <li>Medication Management information</li>
                <li>Emergency and Disaster Management Plan (where participant has been identified as reliant on Decent Care’s supports and services)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>All participants are provided with a copy of the plans and relevant team members are familiarised and have ongoing access to them, as a support referral point. </p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <p><b>Goal Planning, risk management and review process</b><br>The intake procedure provides the basis for all planning (see Intake and Transition Policy and Procedure) and serves as the “About Me” component of the “About me and My Supports”. The About me and My Supports Form provides information about the participant and indicates further planning requirements. The following steps should be taken when conducting support planning with participants:
        <ol>
            <li>Review the incoming transition form to identify previous supports and transition plan. </li>
            <li>Review the About Me and My Supports Form and ensure all plans that are identified as required are included in the participant’s file</li>
            <li>Considering the plans that do apply, commence the goal planning process including any health goals that have been identified. This is undertaken in collaboration with the participant, inviting them to include an advocate in the process. </li>
            <li>Support the participant with access to current and accessible information about appropriate and accessible resources and services to help them make informed decisions and choices</li>
            <li>Identify risks associated with goals and developing management strategies to remove or minimise the impact of the risk. Risks are reviewed regularly to ensure effectiveness</li>
            <li>Explaining the risks and consequences in the choices being considered</li>
            <li>Incorporate flexibility into the planning, development and review steps to capture the ongoing changing needs of participants and their families/carers, including their health needs, sexuality and self-protection requirements</li>
            <li>On completion, ask participant if they would like a copy of the About Me and My Supports Form, Goal Plan and Emergency Plan. Once this has been provided to them, ask them (or their support person) to sign to acknowledge offer of the copy or receipt. </li>
            <li>Enquire with participant if they would like the goal planning documents shared with family, support network or other providers.  If yes, the consent form must be signed </li>
            <li>Where appropriate and with the participant's consent, developing and maintaining linkages through collaboration with other providers by sharing information to help meet the participant's needs</li>
            <li>Adjust the support delivery in a reasonable way and continuously monitoring to ensure it is fit for purpose and the participant's health, privacy, quality of life and independence is supported</li>
            <li>The goal plan document is shared with all Decent Care team members who are involved in the participants supports.  This includes ensuring each team member is trained to respond to emergencies, including how to distinguish between urgent, and non-urgent health situations</li>
            <li>All goal plans and risk assessments are reviewed annually, or sooner if the participant circumstances change, or they request an update. </li>
        </ol></p>

        </ul></p>

        <p><b>Planning Principles</b></p>

        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Person at the centre</p>
            <p>Participants are central to planning and decision-making to achieve their preferred lifestyle. The participant chooses the level of participation in planning according to her or his preference and ability and is encouraged and supported to have as much control as possible over the whole planning process.</p>
        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Considering culture</p>
            <p>Planning takes into consideration the culture, language, religious beliefs and priorities of all people. Planning with a participant is undertaken about social customs and traditions and the individuals own culture and beliefs.</p>
        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Inclusion of others</p>
            <p>In accordance with the person's wishes and consent, their personal support networks and other supporting service providers are actively included in the planning and review process.
            The inclusion of others in the support planning process aims to encourage the ongoing involvement in the person's life, and to encourage and assist growth of the participant's networks and community engagement.
            </p>
        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Personal priorities and strengths</p>
            <p>Intake processes include the identification of the persons strengths, including their personal networks and interests. This information is utilised to develop a capacity building approach and instil confidence in the self-delivery of the plan.</p>
        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Dignity of risk</p>
            <p>Each participant's right to the dignity of risk in decision making is supported. When needed, each participant is supported to make informed choices about the benefits and risks of the options being considered</p>
        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Continuous process</p>
            <p>Planning with the person at the centre is a continuous process of listening, learning and further action and is not a one-off event. Person-centred planning assumes that people with disability have futures, and that their aspirations will change and grow with their experiences.</p>
        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Consultation</p>
            <p>Decent Care operates within a learning culture and supports that each person is the expert in their own lives. Whilst the policy draws on the expertise within Decent Care, the policy will evolve with consultation with team members, participants and their families, carers and advocates.</p>

            <p><b>Training</b></p>
            <p>All team members are trained in intake, assessment, goal planning, review and risk management processes as part of the induction.</p>
