      <h2>Mealtime Management Policy and Procedure</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="policy">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Decent Care management and team members ensure that all meals that are prepared for participants in line with the framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (World Health Organisation), that is incorporated into mealtime management practices.  
        Decent Care recognise that people with disabilities frequently have associated disorders that interfere with nutrition in terms of intake, digestion or absorption of nutrients. They often require assistance from others for nutritional planning, and some are dependent on others for eating and drinking. 
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <h2>Scope </h2>
        <p>This policy applies to team members and any person representing Decent Care who are providing meals or supporting participants with meal preparation. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Principles</h2>
        <p>Decent Care is committed to ensuring they meet the NDIS Legislation Amendment Quality Indicators by ensuring that each participant requiring mealtime management receives meals that are nutritious, and of a texture that is appropriate to their individual needs, appropriately planned, and prepared in an environment and manner that meets their individual needs and preferences. Meals are delivered in a way that is appropriate to their individual needs and ensures meals are enjoyable. This is achieved through:

            <ul>
                <li>•	identifying each participant that requires mealtime management.</li>
                <li>•	Ensuring each participant requiring mealtime management has their individual mealtime management needs assessed by appropriately qualified health practitioners, including by practitioners:
                    <ul>
                        <li>undertaking comprehensive assessments of their nutrition and swallowing; and</li>
                        <li>assessing their seating and positioning requirements for eating and drinking; and</li>
                        <li>providing mealtime management plans which outline their mealtime management needs, including for swallowing, eating and drinking; and</li>
                        <li>reviewing assessments and plans annually or in accordance with the professional advice of the participant’s practitioner, or more frequently if needs change or difficulty is observed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>With their consent, each participant requiring mealtime management is involved in the assessment and development of their mealtime management plans. Each team member responsible for providing mealtime management to participants understands the mealtime management needs of those participants and the steps to take if safety incidents occur during meals, such as coughing or choking on food or fluids.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Procedure</h2>

        <p>Where it is identified that a participant may be experiencing difficulty or have specific nutritional requirements, Decent Care will seek a mealtime management plan. The assessment and planning will be conducted by an appropriately qualified practitioner and in partnership with the participant where consent is provided. Assessment and planning will include the following factors: 
            <ul>
                <li>Participant preferences including their likes and dislikes</li>
                <li>Specific nutritional requirements</li>
                <li>Positioning needs</li>
                <li>Food/fluid consistencies</li>
                <li>Equipment needs</li>
                <li>Communication needs</li>
                <li>Environmental needs </li>
                <li>Social connectedness opportunities</li>
                <li>Considerations when eating out</li>
                <li>Risks and management strategies</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The Mealtime Management is included in participants files, which is easily accessible by all team members who administer the plan. </p>

        <p><b>Team member Training in relation to individual participant mealtime plans:</b><br>Team members who provide mealtime management to participants are provided with information and understand the mealtime management needs of the individual participant. Team members will also understand the specific steps to take if safety incidents occur during meals, such as coughing or choking on food or fluids. This information will also be documented in the mealtime risk management plan. 
        Where a participant has a mealtime plan, information regarding the requirements will be accessible to all team members who are administering the plan for easy reference at all times. 
         </p>

         <p><b>Preparation of texture modified foods:</b><br>
            Team members who are required to provide texture modified foods will ensure the appropriate equipment, including a temperature probe are available to them when undertaking this role. Texture modified meals are provided for participants that have difficulty chewing and swallowing. Texture modified foods may be thickened, minced or pureed. Due to the extra handling involved with the preparation of texture modified foods, there is an increased potential for cross contamination and cases of foodborne illness have been attributed to hygiene failure during this process.  The following steps must be adhered to:</p>

            <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Cleaning and sanitising equipment</p>
            <p>The equipment used will include a procedure or set of work instructions that outline the dismantling, cleaning and sanitising of equipment. Equipment used to homogenise food usually requires complete disassembly to fully clean. Contamination of blenders and mixers has been identified as a potential problem because they are difficult to clean.</p>

            <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Procedure for preparing texture modified foods </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All team members must wash hands thoroughly with soap and warm water and dry thoroughly – clean gloves may be used as an additional barrier.</li>
                    <li>Texture modified foods should be prepared according to the directions for use of the thickening agent or recipe. In some cases a blender might be required to achieve an adequate mix. </li>
                    <li>Any equipment such as blenders and stab mixers should be dismantled to enable thorough and effective cleaning and sanitising. /li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Where food is modified or puréed without cooking: </strong> <br>
                For food that is texture modified and not intended to be cooked (e.g. puréed fruit)
                <ul>
                    <li>Use equipment dedicated to uncooked ready-to-eat foods only </li>
                    <li>Ensure all equipment is clean and sanitised prior to modifying/puréeing</li>
                    <li>Ensure these foods are processed before other foods that need to be cooked </li>
                    <li>Ensure the equipment is cleaned and sanitised in between uses. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Where food is modified or puréed before cooking</strong><br>For food that is texture modified prior to being cooked:
            <ul>
                <li>Minimise the amount of time between texture modification and cooking (e.g. less than 1 hour)</li>
                <li>Thoroughly cook food to temperatures of at least 70°C for 2 minutes (or use an equivalent process) </li>
                <li>Ensure texture modified food remains above 60°C before serving.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Where food is modified or puréed after cooking: </strong><br>For food that is intended to be texture modified after cooking:
            <ul>
                <li>Thoroughly cook food to temperatures of at least 70°C for 2 minutes (or use an equivalent process). </li>
                <li>To limit the risk of contaminating foods that are thickened, puréed or cut up after cooking: – process food in an area away from raw meats and other non ready-to-eat foods on equipment dedicated to ready-to-eat foods only,</li>
                <li>Texture modify or purée food immediately after cooking</li>
                <li>Ensure food is cooled in compliance with Food Standards Code requirements (the ‘2- hour/4-hour cooling rule’) such that the food is cooled: – within two hours—from 60°C to 21°C – within a further four hours— from 21°C to 5°C – then modified once cooled. </li>
                <li>Ensure all equipment has been dismantled, cleaned and sanitised before use.</li>
                <li>Minimise the amount of time it takes to texture modify the food before chilling (e.g. place in cool room as soon as possible). </li>
                <li>Minimise the amount of time texture modified food is stored between cooking and reheating: – Refrigeration should be limited to 48 hours at 5°C or below – Frozen food should be used within 48 hours of being thawed </li>
                <li>Foods should be reheated to 70°C for 2 minutes (or equivalent) prior to serving.</li>
                <li>Serve reheated food above 60°C Texture modifying left-over food Left-over food from the plating line may be texture modified providing it is refrigerated during plating or processed within 2 hours of food temperature entering the danger zone. Reheating should allow for potential Listeria monocytogenes contamination (70C for 2 minutes).</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p><b>On provision of meals:</b><br>When a team member is providing meals, the following procedures must be followed:
                <ul>
                    <li>Review the prepared food against the plan on each occasion</li>
                    <li>Check with the participant that they are satisfied with the mealtime experience</li>
                    <li>Document any expressed dislikes or issues that arise during mealtimes</li>
                    <li>Ensure food is stored safely and identified as the specific participants requirement</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p><b>When supporting a person to eat their food</b><br>If physically supporting a participant to eat, team members must be aware of the individual participants health risks (such as swallowing difficulties, diabetes, anaphylaxis, food allergies, obesity or being underweight) and manage those risks accordingly
                <ul>
                    <li>Always follow the person’s mealtime support plan including the risk management plan. </li>
                    <li>Check that the person is alert and as upright as possible</li>
                    <li>Make sure that small amounts of food are being offered</li>
                    <li>Wait for food to clear from the person’s mouth before offering more</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p><b>Complications during mealtime:</b><br>If the team member who is providing the food observes:
            <ul>
                <li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
                <li>Choking or gagging</li>
                <li>Bringing food back up</li>
                <li>Wet ‘gurgly’ sound voice or breathing</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Team members must: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follow management strategies outlined in the Mealtime Plan</li>
                    <li>If necessary, contact the Ambulance </li>
                    <li>Advise their Program Manager </li>
                    <li>Wait with the participant until the participant has been assessed</li>
                    <li>Document the event in the participant progress notes</li>
                    <li>Seek a Practitioner Mealtime Management Plan review if the complication has not been previously identified. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
