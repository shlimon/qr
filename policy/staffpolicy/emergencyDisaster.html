    <div class="section">
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <p><b>Governance Risk Management</b> <br>Decent Care Governance Framework includes a Business Continuity Plan and Emergency Plan (BCP) that provides key contacts and directions for team members to follow in the case of an emergency The BCP is tested and reviewed regularly to maintain effectiveness. Reports of testing are reviewed by the Managing Directors and remedial actions are undertaken. Testing processes include:
        <ul>
            <li>Testing information backup systems</li>
            <li>Testing team members knowledge</li>
            <li>Testing participant knowledge of their personal Emergency Plans. </li>
            <li>Seeking feedback from team members and participants about the plans in place. </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Furthermore, risks and associated strategies are documented in the Business Risk Management Register. See also Master Register</p>

        <p><b>Emergency Officer </b> <br>The Emergency Plan identifies an Emergency Officer. The Emergency Officer (in this case the Managing Directors) will provide leadership and delegation in the following processes:
        <ul>
            <li>Review the BCP</li>
            <li>Undertake communications with Emergency Services</li>

            <li>Undertake communications with team members ensuring that participant emergency plans are actioned</li>
            <li>Document all actions within the BCP Incident Event Log and Incident Response Checklists</li>
            <li>Monitor progress and team members to support participants</li>
            <li>Seek additional support if necessary, e.g sourcing additional team members</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><b>Participant Personal Emergency Management Plans</b> <br>Each participant who is deemed to rely on the service for daily needs undertakes Emergency Planning at the commencement of service as part of the Intake Process. 
        The Emergency Management Plan is located within the participant file that includes the following critical information that is necessary in an emergency:
        <ul>
            <li>Participant Profile</li>
            <li>Participant Goals</li>
            <li>Risk Assessment</li>

            <li>Participant Behaviour Support Plan</li>
            <li>Any other relevant documentation </li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>The plan is explained to the participant and their support network in a language, terms and mode of communication that will best suit their communication needs. 
        The Emergency Officer will monitor weather conditions and implement the Emergency Management Plan prior to the event, to ensure that participants are supported during an emergency or disaster situation. 
        </p>

        <p>Team members must action the Personal Emergency Plan and review all other critical information e.g medical plans prior to undertaking action in an emergency.</p>
        <p>The Managing Directors must be advised immediately by team members about any difficulties experienced in actioning the plan </p>
