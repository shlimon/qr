      <h2>NDIS Code Of Conduct</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="policy">
      <div class="section">
        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p>Decent Care has adopted the underpinning principles of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) Code of Conduct (the Code) as set out in the National Disability Insurance Scheme (Code of Conduct) Rules 2018.</p> 
        <p>The obligations in the Code are fundamental to the rights of people with disability set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
        Decent Care respects and supports the fundamental rights of participants to continue living independently in their own homes and communities with dignity and respect, along with choice and inclusion concerning their support needs and being free to engage an advocate and/or representative of their choice. </p>    
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>The Managing Directors in addition to all team members, contractors and students are required to refer to the policies outlined in the manual throughout their work, as they govern our operations and service delivery. They are expected to uphold the Policy Manual's content and raise any questions or issues.  Related policies and procedures should be read in conjunction with this policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Code</h2>
        <p>This Code of Conduct sets out, in principle, the behaviours and standards of conduct expected of management, team members and students of the organisation who are providing support and services to a person and to uphold the rights of all participants. </p>

        <p>By offering services to participants, Decent Care always will strive to:  
            <b>Act with respect for individual rights to freedom of expression, self-determination and decision-making in accordance with applicable laws and conventions</b>
            Supporting people with disability to have the right to make their own decisions, to be free to live the life they choose and to have the same rights and freedoms as any other member of the community. All Decent Care team members undertake to understand and educate others that people with disability have full and equal human rights, debunking the historical portrayal of them being dependent, helpless and in need of care and protection.
            </p>

            <p><b >Decent Care will deliver services in a way that maintains the standards and principles that underpin the NDIS </b><br>
                By delivering supports and services in accordance with the NDIS rules made under the NDIS Act (2013), Decent Care will maintain the standards and principles and uphold the conventions that underpin the NDIS. This includes the principle of the United Nations Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities as well as other international human rights treaties named in the NDIS Act. 
                Decent Care will also comply with the National Disability Insurance Scheme (Provider Registration and Practice Standards) Rules 2018, which has been developed in line with the National Standards for Disability Services and the National Standards for Mental Health Services.
            </p>

            <p><b>Decent Care will support people with disability to make decisions </b>
            <br>
            Decent Care will support the right to freedom of expression and the right to make decisions about and exercise control over, their own lives. Decent Care ensures people with disability have the right to choice and control about who supports them and how their supports are delivered. They will support people with disability to make decisions by directly engaging with people on any choices or decisions that affect them. People with disability will be consulted about who, if anyone, they want to involve in decisions and discussions about their services and supports, or other aspects of their life.  When a legal guardian or nominee is present, Decent Care will strive to be clear on the decision of which they need to involve them in decision making. However, Decent Care will ensure they listen and support the person to make their own decisions and undertake a Supported Decision-Making model when appropriate.
            </p>

            <p><b>Decent Care will communicate in a form, language and manner that enables people with disability to understand the information and make known their will and preferences </b><br>
                Decent Care supports the right for people with disability to question, seek additional information on, or refuse to receive any part of service.  
                Decent Care will deliver this by: 
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Communicating in a form, language and manner that is accessible and appropriate for the individual and to use a range of communication tools to communicate with people being supported, using assistive technology and alternative forms of communication such as email, text messages or symbols. </li>

                    <li>Where a person speaks a language other than English or uses Auslan, match the person with a team member who speaks their language or uses Auslan (where possible) or provide supports using qualified interpreters, where these supports are covered by their NDIS plan. </li>


                    <li>Confirm that the person with disability and their families, carer or advocates (where relevant) understand what has been explained and are aware of the potential benefits and risks associated with any part of a proposed plan for the delivery of supports and services. </li>

                    <li>
                        Respond to the will, preferences and concerns of the person with disability in relation to their supports and services – addressing requests or complaints where necessary. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Where possible, provide consistent team members, so that they can build a good understanding of individual communication preferences and needs, particularly where an individual has complex communication needs. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                        <p><b>Identify and respond to incidents of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation and report these to the NDIS Commission and, as appropriate, to other relevant authorities </b><br>
                            Decent Care is committed to identifying and responding to incidents of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation and report these to the NDIS Commission and, as appropriate to other relevant authorities. If an incident or criminal act of violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation does occur, the primary focus of Decent Care is that all people affected are safe and: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Abide by State and National mandatory reporting requirements</li>

                        <p>Any act of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation by a participant prompts an assessment/re-assessment of a participant’s service package and the delivery of services to ensure their supports are being delivered in a constructive manner that maximises the benefit to the participant. This includes a review of any behaviour support plans by a specialist behaviour support provider to reduce the risks of future violence.</p>

                        <p>Decent Care notes and is aware that if the NDIS notes that a team member considers that a NDIS provider has not responded appropriately to incidents of violence, abuse and neglect or if they think the matter might be of more systemic significance, they are encouraged to report the incident to the NDIS Commission. </p>

                        <p>Decent Care will not use adverse action or threats of adverse action against a team member and understand that the NDIS Commission has legislative powers to protect team members and other people who report incidents to the NDIS Commission and can take regulatory action. </p>

                        <p><b>Reduce and eliminate restrictive practices </b><br>Decent Care does not undertake restrictive practice, however, is committed to reducing and eliminating restrictive practices and understands that it is recognised that they represent serious human rights infringements and that these routines are harmful and often exacerbate the behaviours they were intended to address. </p>

                        <p><b>Take all reasonable steps to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct </b><br>
                            Decent Care supports the right of people with disability to sexual expression and to develop and maintain sexual relationships. Decent Care is committed to providing access to information and supports to assist them to make informed and positive choices about sex, sexuality, relationships and reproductive health and wellbeing, as well as exercise their rights regarding privacy. 
                            Decent Care understands that sexual misconduct is a broad term that encompasses any unwelcome acts or behaviour that are experienced by the person with disability. This includes physical and verbal actions committed without consent or by force, intimidation, coercion or manipulation. It includes sexual violence and exploitation but is not limited to actions which constitute a criminal offence. 
                            Decent Care is committed to their responsibility of the key role in implementing practices that minimise the risk of sexual misconduct with clear guidance for team member behaviour and processes for reporting sexual misconduct to the NDIS Commission and any other relevant authorities.

                        <p><b>Have in place clear guidance for team member behaviour </b><br>
                            Clear guidance for team member behaviour and response to sexual misconduct is outlined in the team member induction code of conduct training. It explicitly indicates that team members are expected to adhere to the highest standards of behaviour, be respectful and take every action to make sure people with disabilities are safe. <br>
                            This includes having professional boundaries in place for relationships between team members and people with disability and preventing and responding to any inappropriate behaviours by anyone to a person with disability, including sexual misconduct. The code of conduct details that team members will not commit sexual misconduct with persons with disability that they support. <br>
                            Guidance for NDIS team members includes: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Distinguishing between sexual misconduct and appropriate conversations around a participant’s sexual support or family planning needs</li>
                            <li>Distinguishing between inappropriate touching and appropriate touching  </li>
                            <li>Guide team members in setting boundaries with the person they are working with  </li>
                            <li>Guide team members in determining whether their own or others’ relationships have become inappropriate and instruct them to cease any such relationship</li>
                            <li>It is understood that team members found not to have complied with a professional code or standard regarding sexual misconduct whilst providing NDIS supports and services may be regarded as breaching the NDIS Code of Conduct. </li>
                        </ul></p>

                        <p><b>Operate effective processes for dealing with sexual misconduct </b><br>
                            Decent Care undertakes effective processes for dealing with sexual misconduct by ensuring there are appropriate policies and procedures in place for team members to identify and report any alleged sexual misconduct, unlawful sexual or physical conduct or inappropriate relationships internally and to the NDIS Commission and other relevant authorities. 
                            Decent Care is committed to creating an environment in which people with disability feel safe and are informed about how to make a complaint about any alleged sexual misconduct and without fear of retribution or loss of service. Decent Care also has processes in place to facilitate access to independent advocacy support, or support for harm or trauma experiences if the person desires this support. 
                            Decent Care is aware of its requirement to notify the NDIS Commission under The National Disability Insurance Scheme (Reportable Incidents) Rules 2018 about allegations of sexual misconduct.
