        <p style ="text-decoration: underline;">Participant Risk:</p>
        <p><strong>Vulnerability Assessment (My Safety Plan)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Each participants individual risks are identified on entry into the service through the My Safety Assessment, that identifies their individual risks and includes a vulnerability assessment process. This process identifies participants who are vulnerable in terms of violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation and discrimination when receiving supports in the community. </li>
            <li>This assessment also identifies the extent to which individual participant rely on their service in the event of a natural disaster or emergency. </li>
