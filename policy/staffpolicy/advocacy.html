    <div class="policy">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Decent Care is committed to pursuing the rights and principles of equality, independence, choice and inclusion that underpin a person- centred philosophy.
        In achieving this goal, Decent Care acknowledge that some participants may need assistance to understand issues fully and to voice individual needs and concerns. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the National Disability Strategy promotes social and economic inclusion for people with disability. The availability of high quality, accurate, appropriate and timely information is a key determinant of how well a person can plan and make decisions that affect their lives. Decent Care recognises and supports that participants have the right to choose to involve an advocate to act on their behalf and promote, protect and ensure their full and equal enjoyment of all human rights enabling community participation.
        The purpose of this policy is to provide an overarching framework for recognition and engagement with advocates who are working with participants to ensure that the rights and wishes of the individual are adequately informed and at the centre of the decision-making process.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>This policy applies to all Management, team members and any other person who represents Decent Care. </p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <h2>Principles</h2>
        <p>Decent Care recognises that for a person to lead an inclusive life they may require their family, friends, colleagues and other important people in their life to have access to information so they can better support and interact to achieve real social inclusion.  In order to exercise choice and maximise independence, people require access to accurate information that will help them manage their own lives, understand their options, manage issues and grievances, access community, and engage on topics of interest.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Policy</h2>
        <p>Decent Care acknowledges that any participant of the service has the right to seek support of an advocate or advocacy agency to help them with all aspects of service delivery provided by Decent Care or from other providers.
            Whenever possible participants will be supported and encouraged to self-advocate however, Decent Care will facilitate access for a participant to use an advocate should they wish Decent Care to do so.
            It is acknowledged that at times Decent Care team members will be asked to attend meetings in a professional capacity to present information on behalf of the participant. In these circumstances it is expected that this representation will be restricted to senior team member positions.
            Decent Care will not disclose any information about the participant to an advocate, when the participant is not present, unless the participant has given express permission to do so. If a participant wishes the organisation to disclose information to an advocate, they will be required to disclose this information in writing. 
            </p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <p><b>Advocacy in relation to Decent Care</b><br>
            At first point of contact, participants will be advised of their right to have someone represent their interest and to assist them with part or all aspects of their service delivery, including planning, review, complaints and incidents. 
            Contact details for advocates are listed in their Participant Welcome Pack.
            Team members must ensure the participant is aware of their right to use an advocate, and regularly remind participants of this opportunity. This information is explained as part of the planning review process or as needed. This includes instances where participants are:

                <li>Making initial contact with the service</li>
                <li>Transitioned and orientated to the service</li>
                <li>Transitioned out or refused service.</li>
                <h5>Or If:</h5>
                <li>They wish to make a complaint about the service</li>
                <li>A team member believes an advocate may be beneficial for the person</li>
                <li>Where support is required in decision making. </li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>Participants will be provided information regarding available advocacy services at any time, if requested. Decent Care will assist with a referral if required.

            </p>

            <p><b>Advocacy in relation to another organisation</b><br>
                Decent Care provides individual advocacy to people using the service, in relation to another organisation, where such advocacy falls within the scope of the organisations service delivery, information provision and referral roles.
