    </div>

    <div class="policy">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Decent Care may transport participants in their role of support provision. This Policy has been developed to ensure the safety of team members and participants when service delivery requires the use of vehicles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>This policy and procedure applies to all team members who are transporting participants as part of their duties when working for Decent Care.</p>
    </div>
    

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Principles</h2>
        <p>Decent Care is committed to ensuring high standards of safety to team members and participants when transporting participants as part of service provision. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <p>The Managing Directors will: 
            <ul>
                <li>•	Ensure comprehensive insurance and a roadside assistance scheme is in place for all Decent Care-owned vehicles</li>
                <li>•	Implement a maintenance program for vehicles used in its service delivery (owned, leased and privately owned) to ensure safety, roadworthiness, reporting/clearing of defects and passenger comfort</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The Program Managers will:  <ul>
            <li>Review the appropriateness of vehicles used by Decent Care team members for the types of work activities they are undertaking</li>
            <li>Review and analyse all vehicle incidents in line with the Incident Management Policy</li>
            <li>Ensure relevant team members have valid driver licenses and verify these within the Master Register</li>
            <li>Ensure team members using their own vehicles have current registration and compulsory third party (CTP) insurance in place</li>
            <li>Ensure all Decent Care vehicles are supplied with equipment such as first aid kits, emergency contact numbers, torches and other required emergency supplies</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>Team members must apply normal hazard and risk management techniques in their day-to-day work and whenever driving any vehicle.  Certain driving environments will present a greater hazard than others. </p>

        <p>The following instructions must be adhered to:  
            <ul>
                <li>Team member to advise their Program Manager of planned itinerary when travelling long distances to ensure whereabouts are known </li>
                <li>Phone or text their Program Manager on return, to advise of safe arrival, if not returning to the office</li>
                <li>Ensure mobile phone and charger is in on hand in the case of an incident</li>
                <li>Do not drive unlicensed</li>
                <li>Do not drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol</li>
                <li>Conduct pre-use safety checks of vehicles (see below)</li>
                <li>Where possible, ensure participants being transported are not seated behind the driver and are secured appropriately</li>
                <li>Follow all applicable road rules at all times</li>
                <li>Take regular breaks from continuous driving as required, and at least every two hours</li>
                <li>Avoid driving vehicles in off-road environments</li>
                <li>Team member must report any vehicle accidents immediately to their Program Manager</li>
                <li>Report immobilisation events including breakdown and bogging as an incident in accordance with Decent Care’ Incident Management Policy and Procedure to enable better information to be gathered regarding the suitability of vehicles and the training provided to team members.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>


        <p><b>Vehicle safety checks</b> <br>Decent Care will ensure the manufacturer's specified service schedule is being adhered to and any identified vehicle faults or wear and tear items are repaired. The vehicle must not be used if there is a mechanical concern, or where the pre-safety check identifies an issue with the vehicle's safety. The Managing Directors will arrange for repair of the vehicle before it is returned to service. <br>When undertaking vehicle pre-use safety checks, team members will, at a minimum:
        <ul>
            <li>Inspect all external lights (grime can reduce their effectiveness by up to 40%)</li>
            <li>Inspect wiper blades to ensure they clear the windscreen effectively</li>
            <li>Clean the windscreen and rear window to ensure good visibility</li>
            <li>Periodically check all fluid levels - engine oil, windscreen washer fluid and the radiator coolant</li>
            <li>Check tyre pressure and condition; and</li>
            <li>Ensure mirrors are present and oriented correctly for use.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><b>Seat belts</b> <br>By law, all occupants of a vehicle must wear seatbelts at all times. If a seat belt is starting to show signs of wear and tear, (frayed, not retracting back) the vehicle needs to be seen by an authorised repairer. For Decent Care-owned vehicles (where applicable), team members should refer the matter to their Program Manager. If transporting participants who cannot wear a seat belt, the participant must have a doctor’s certificate and team member must carry this approval with them when transporting those participants.</p>

        <p><b>Mobile phones</b> <br>Team members must not use a hand-held mobile telephone whilst driving. Team members must pull over and stop the vehicle’s engine before answering or making phone calls or reading or responding to texts.</p>


        <p><b>Speed</b><br>Team members must drive at a speed that suits the road conditions, vehicle, weather conditions and their driving experience.  Team members must not exceed the applicable speed limit for the road used. In the event a team member is issued with an infringement notice while driving a company owned vehicle, the team member will be nominated as the responsible driver and will be accountable for payment of the infringement and any demerit points.</p>


        <p><b>Participant transport</b><br>Team members should undertake a risk assessment to determine if a participant can be transported alone in a vehicle.  Generally, participants with behaviours of concern should not be seated behind the driver and must wear a seat belt.  Team members must consider how best to transfer mobility restricted participants or handling wheelchairs or equipment, using good manual handling techniques to prevent an injury.</p>

    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <h2>Reporting</h2>
        <p>In the event that a vehicle incident occurs, incident reporting procedures must be followed as per the Incident Management Policy (for participant injury/harm) and Work, Health and Safety Policy (for team member injury/harm).
        If the incident involves a collision/damage to other vehicles or property, then additional details of the other parties involved must also be taken, including:
        <ul>
            <li>•	Full Names</li>
            <li>•	Registration number (if a vehicle is involved)</li>
            <li>•	Details of insurer</li>
            <li>•	Contact number.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Depending on the nature of the incident and outcomes of the investigation, a review of the risk assessment and strategies for preventing an incident will be conducted before resuming any further services using vehicles.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The participant's money, or other property, is only used with the consent of the participant and for the purposed intended by the participant. Team members must not give financial advice or information.</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p><b>Home visits</b><br>Team members must only use and touch the participant's property to deliver a service for example, the use of equipment in completion of tasks. </p>



    <p><b>Supported Independent Living/ Respite Customers</b><br>Where participants reside within a Supported Independent Living or respite setting and require assistance to manage their personal spending, Decent Care will hold individual participant labelled pencil cases with transaction records to record money received and  participant expenditure. All receipts will be held in the pencil case and reconciled weekly or at the end of the respite period whichever is sooner</p>

    <p><b>Financial management guidelines</b><br>At times, participants may require assistance with their finances, e.g., paying bills, banking or shopping. Team members must follow guidelines and procedures outlined below when financially assisting a participant:
        <ul>
            <li>Team members are at <strong>no time</strong> allowed access to a participant’s personal identification number (PIN) unless written permission is provided by the participant. </li>
            <li>Transaction receipts must be obtained and provided to the participant for the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Money Received </li>
                    <li>Money Spent</li>
                    <li>Money Returned</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The team member must be sure to count the money in front of the participant on receipt and return</li>
            <li>Team members must record all financial transactions carried out for a participant in the Financial Transaction Record and recorded in the participant’s progress notes. Records must be documented clearly, accurately and immediately</li>
            <li>Team members must not give financial advice to participants or their companions, or act as a witness for any legal documents</li>
            <li>Team members must not accept money or gifts from participants.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>


    <p><b>Suspected financial abuse</b><br>Where team members suspect financial abuse when working with participants, they discuss preventative measures with participants, including:
    <ul>
        <li>Informing the participant not to relinquish control of their finances, if the participant can self-manage</li>
        <li>Advising the participant not to make significant financial decisions following a major event, e.g. Loss of a partner</li>
        <li>Ensuring that the participant is aware of their right to refuse people access to their funds or personal money</li>
        <li>Encouraging the participant to ask for help if they are overwhelmed, confused, or feel they are being taken advantage of</li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <p>If any team member suspects that a participant is being financially abused, then the following steps are to be taken: 

        <ol>
            <li>The team member is to gather evidence and record in participant's notes</li>
            <li>The team member is to contact their Program Manager to discuss evidence gathered</li>
            <li>The Program Manager will gather the details of the abuse and report to the Managing Directors.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>The Managing Directors will  make a report to relevant authorities for example the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission through Incident Reporting.</p>


    <p><b>Participant fees and payments for NDIS participants </b></p>
    <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Payments and pricing (NDIS)</p>
    <p>
        <ul>

            <li>No other charges are to be added to the cost of the support (including credit card surcharges) or any additional fees including any ‘gap’ fees, late payment fees or cancellation fees. These requirements apply to all participants, whether the participant self-manages their funding or whether funding is managed by a plan managed, or by the agency</li>
            <li>A claim for payment is to be submitted within a reasonable time (and no later than sixty (60) days from the end of the service booking) to the participant or the NDIS</li>
            <li>Decent Care and participants (except for those that are self-managing) cannot contract out of the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where there are any inconsistencies between the Service Agreement and the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits, the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits prevails</li>
            <li>Where required, Decent Care will obtain a quote for services and have this approved by the participant</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
