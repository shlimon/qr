          <p>
            This page was written in HTML and CSS. The CSS was compiled from
            SASS. I used Normalize as my CSS reset and -prefix-free to save
            myself some headaches. I haven't quite gotten the hang of Slim for
            compiling into HTML, but someday I'll use it since its syntax
            compliments that of SASS. Regardless, this could all be done in
            plain HTML and CSS.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <input type="checkbox" checked />
          <i></i>
          <h2>May 2022</h2>
          <p>
            Using the sibling and checked selectors, we can determine the
            styling of sibling elements based on the checked state of the
            checkbox input element. One use, as demonstrated here, is an
            entirely CSS and HTML accordion element. Media queries are used to
            make the element responsive to different screen sizes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <input type="checkbox" checked />
          <i></i>
          <h2>August 2022</h2>
          <p>
            By making the open state default for when :checked isn't detected,
            we can make this system accessable for browsers that don't recognize
            :checked. The fallback is simply an open accordion. The accordion
            can be manipulated with Javascript (if needed) by changing the
            "checked" property of the input element.
